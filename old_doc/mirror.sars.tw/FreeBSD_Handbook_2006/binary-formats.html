Formats</a></h1>

<p>To understand why FreeBSD uses the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=elf&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">elf</span>(5)</span></a> format, you
must first know a little about the three currently “dominant” executable formats for
<span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg;:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=a.out&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">a.out</span>(5)</span></a></p>

<p>The oldest and “classic” <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> object format. It uses
a short and compact header with a magic number at the beginning that is often used to
characterize the format (see <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=a.out&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">a.out</span>(5)</span></a> for more
details). It contains three loaded segments: .text, .data, and .bss plus a symbol table
and a string table.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">COFF</acronym></p>

<p>The SVR3 object format. The header now comprises a section table, so you can have more
than just .text, .data, and .bss sections.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=elf&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">elf</span>(5)</span></a></p>

<p>The successor to <acronym class="ACRONYM">COFF</acronym>, featuring multiple sections
and 32-bit or 64-bit possible values. One major drawback: <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> was also designed with the assumption that there would be
only one ABI per system architecture. That assumption is actually quite incorrect, and
not even in the commercial SYSV world (which has at least three ABIs: SVR4, Solaris, SCO)
does it hold true.</p>

<p>FreeBSD tries to work around this problem somewhat by providing a utility for <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">branding</i></span> a known <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> executable with information about the ABI it is compliant
with. See the manual page for <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=brandelf&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">brandelf</span>(1)</span></a> for more
information.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>FreeBSD comes from the “classic” camp and used the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=a.out&amp;sektion=5"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">a.out</span>(5)</span></a> format, a
technology tried and proven through many generations of BSD releases, until the beginning
of the 3.X branch. Though it was possible to build and run native <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> binaries (and kernels) on a FreeBSD system for some time
before that, FreeBSD initially resisted the “push” to switch to <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> as the default format. Why? Well, when the Linux camp made
their painful transition to <acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym>, it was not so much to
flee the <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> executable format as it was their inflexible
jump-table based shared library mechanism, which made the construction of shared
libraries very difficult for vendors and developers alike. Since the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> tools available offered a solution to the shared library
problem and were generally seen as “the way forward” anyway, the migration cost was
accepted as necessary and the transition made. FreeBSD's shared library mechanism is
based more closely on Sun's <span class="TRADEMARK">SunOS</span>&#8482; style shared
library mechanism and, as such, is very easy to use.</p>

<p>So, why are there so many different formats?</p>

<p>Back in the dim, dark past, there was simple hardware. This simple hardware supported
a simple, small system. <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> was completely adequate for the
job of representing binaries on this simple system (a PDP-11). As people ported <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> from this simple system, they retained the <tt
class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> format because it was sufficient for the early ports of <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span> to architectures like the Motorola 68k, VAXen, etc.</p>

<p>Then some bright hardware engineer decided that if he could force software to do some
sleazy tricks, then he would be able to shave a few gates off the design and allow his
CPU core to run faster. While it was made to work with this new kind of hardware (known
these days as <acronym class="ACRONYM">RISC</acronym>), <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt>
was ill-suited for this hardware, so many formats were developed to get to a better
performance from this hardware than the limited, simple <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt>
format could offer. Things like <acronym class="ACRONYM">COFF</acronym>, <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ECOFF</acronym>, and a few obscure others were invented and their
limitations explored before things seemed to settle on <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym>.</p>

<p>In addition, program sizes were getting huge and disks (and physical memory) were
still relatively small so the concept of a shared library was born. The VM system also
became more sophisticated. While each one of these advancements was done using the <tt
class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> format, its usefulness was stretched more and more with each
new feature. In addition, people wanted to dynamically load things at run time, or to
junk parts of their program after the init code had run to save in core memory and swap
space. Languages became more sophisticated and people wanted code called before main
automatically. Lots of hacks were done to the <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> format to
allow all of these things to happen, and they basically worked for a time. In time, <tt
class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> was not up to handling all these problems without an ever
increasing overhead in code and complexity. While <acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym>
solved many of these problems, it would be painful to switch from the system that
basically worked. So <acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> had to wait until it was more
painful to remain with <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> than it was to migrate to <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym>.</p>

<p>However, as time passed, the build tools that FreeBSD derived their build tools from
(the assembler and loader especially) evolved in two parallel trees. The FreeBSD tree
added shared libraries and fixed some bugs. The GNU folks that originally wrote these
programs rewrote them and added simpler support for building cross compilers, plugging in
different formats at will, and so on. Since many people wanted to build cross compilers
targeting FreeBSD, they were out of luck since the older sources that FreeBSD had for <b
class="APPLICATION">as</b> and <b class="APPLICATION">ld</b> were not up to the task. The
new GNU tools chain (<b class="APPLICATION">binutils</b>) does support cross compiling,
<acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym>, shared libraries, C++ extensions, etc. In
addition, many vendors are releasing <acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> binaries, and
it is a good thing for FreeBSD to run them.</p>

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> is more expressive than <tt
class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> and allows more extensibility in the base system. The
<acronym class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> tools are better maintained, and offer cross
compilation support, which is important to many people. <acronym
class="ACRONYM">ELF</acronym> may be a little slower than <tt
class="FILENAME">a.out</tt>, but trying to measure it can be difficult. There are also
numerous details that are different between the two in how they map pages, handle init
code, etc. None of these are very important, but they are differences. In time support
for <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> will be moved out of the <tt
class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> kernel, and eventually removed from the kernel once the
need to run legacy <tt class="FILENAME">a.out</tt> programs is past.</p>
