<h1 class="SECT1"><a id="CURRENT-STABLE" name="CURRENT-STABLE">21.2 FreeBSD-CURRENT vs.
FreeBSD-STABLE</a></h1>

<p>There are two development branches to FreeBSD: FreeBSD-CURRENT and FreeBSD-STABLE.
This section will explain a bit about each and describe how to keep your system
up-to-date with each respective tree. FreeBSD-CURRENT will be discussed first, then
FreeBSD-STABLE.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="CURRENT" name="CURRENT">21.2.1 Staying Current with
FreeBSD</a></h2>

<p>As you read this, keep in mind that FreeBSD-CURRENT is the “bleeding edge” of
FreeBSD development. FreeBSD-CURRENT users are expected to have a high degree of
technical skill, and should be capable of solving difficult system problems on their own.
If you are new to FreeBSD, think twice before installing it.</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN28175" name="AEN28175">21.2.1.1 What Is
FreeBSD-CURRENT?</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD-CURRENT is the latest working sources for FreeBSD. This includes work in
progress, experimental changes, and transitional mechanisms that might or might not be
present in the next official release of the software. While many FreeBSD developers
compile the FreeBSD-CURRENT source code daily, there are periods of time when the sources
are not buildable. These problems are resolved as expeditiously as possible, but whether
or not FreeBSD-CURRENT brings disaster or greatly desired functionality can be a matter
of which exact moment you grabbed the source code in!</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN28180" name="AEN28180">21.2.1.2 Who Needs
FreeBSD-CURRENT?</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD-CURRENT is made available for 3 primary interest groups:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Members of the FreeBSD community who are actively working on some part of the source
tree and for whom keeping “current” is an absolute requirement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Members of the FreeBSD community who are active testers, willing to spend time solving
problems in order to ensure that FreeBSD-CURRENT remains as sane as possible. These are
also people who wish to make topical suggestions on changes and the general direction of
FreeBSD, and submit patches to implement them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Those who merely wish to keep an eye on things, or to use the current sources for
reference purposes (e.g. for <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">reading</i></span>, not running). These people also make the occasional
comment or contribute code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN28192" name="AEN28192">21.2.1.3 What Is FreeBSD-CURRENT <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">Not</i></span>?</a></h3>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>A fast-track to getting pre-release bits because you heard there is some cool new
feature in there and you want to be the first on your block to have it. Being the first
on the block to get the new feature means that you are the first on the block to get the
new bugs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A quick way of getting bug fixes. Any given version of FreeBSD-CURRENT is just as
likely to introduce new bugs as to fix existing ones.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In any way “officially supported”. We do our best to help people genuinely in one of
the 3 “legitimate” FreeBSD-CURRENT groups, but we simply <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">do not have the time</i></span> to provide tech support. This is not
because we are mean and nasty people who do not like helping people out (we would not
even be doing FreeBSD if we were). We simply cannot answer hundreds messages a day <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">and</i></span> work on FreeBSD! Given the choice
between improving FreeBSD and answering lots of questions on experimental code, the
developers opt for the former.</p>

<p>Join the <a href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">freebsd-current</a> and the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-all" target="_top">cvs-all</a> lists.
This is not just a good idea, it is <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">essential</i></span>. If you are not on the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS"><a href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">freebsd-current</a></i></span> list, you will not see the comments that
people are making about the current state of the system and thus will probably end up
stumbling over a lot of problems that others have already found and solved. Even more
importantly, you will miss out on important bulletins which may be critical to your
system's continued health.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-all"
target="_top">cvs-all</a> list will allow you to see the commit log entry for each change
as it is made along with any pertinent information on possible side-effects.</p>

<p>To join these lists, or one of the others available go to <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo"
target="_top">http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo</a> and click on the list that
you wish to subscribe to. Instructions on the rest of the procedure are available
there.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Grab the sources from a FreeBSD <a href="mirrors.html">mirror site</a>. You can do
this in one of two ways:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="cvsup.html">cvsup</a> program with the <tt
class="FILENAME">supfile</tt> named <tt class="FILENAME">standard-supfile</tt> available
from <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/share/examples/cvsup</tt>. This is the most recommended
method, since it allows you to grab the entire collection once and then only what has
changed from then on. Many people run <tt class="COMMAND">cvsup</tt> from <tt
class="COMMAND">cron</tt> and keep their sources up-to-date automatically. You have to
customize the sample <tt class="FILENAME">supfile</tt> above, and configure <a
href="cvsup.html">cvsup</a> for your environment.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use the <b class="APPLICATION"><a href="ctm.html">CTM</a></b> facility. If you have
very bad connectivity (high price connections or only email access) <b
class="APPLICATION">CTM</b> is an option. However, it is a lot of hassle and can give you
broken files. This leads to it being rarely used, which again increases the chance of it
not working for fairly long periods of time. We recommend using <b class="APPLICATION"><a
href="cvsup.html">CVSup</a></b> for anybody with a 9600&nbsp;bps modem or faster
connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you are grabbing the sources to run, and not just look at, then grab <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> of FreeBSD-CURRENT, not just selected
portions. The reason for this is that various parts of the source depend on updates
elsewhere, and trying to compile just a subset is almost guaranteed to get you into
trouble.</p>

<p>Before compiling FreeBSD-CURRENT, read the <tt class="FILENAME">Makefile</tt> in <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src</tt> carefully. You should at least <a
href="makeworld.html">install a new kernel and rebuild the world</a> the first time
through as part of the upgrading process. Reading the <a
href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-current"
target="_top">FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a> and <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src/UPDATING</tt> will keep you up-to-date on other bootstrapping
procedures that sometimes become necessary as we move toward the next release.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be active! If you are running FreeBSD-CURRENT, we want to know what you have to say
about it, especially if you have suggestions for enhancements or bug fixes. Suggestions
with accompanying code are received most enthusiastically!</p>

FreeBSD</a></h2>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN28273" name="AEN28273">21.2.2.1 What Is
FreeBSD-STABLE?</a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD-STABLE is our development branch from which major releases are made. Changes
go into this branch at a different pace, and with the general assumption that they have
first gone into FreeBSD-CURRENT for testing. This is <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">still</i></span> a development branch, however, and this means that at
any given time, the sources for FreeBSD-STABLE may or may not be suitable for any
particular purpose. It is simply another engineering development track, not a resource
for end-users.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN28279" name="AEN28279">21.2.2.2 Who Needs
FreeBSD-STABLE?</a></h3>

<p>If you are interested in tracking or contributing to the FreeBSD development process,
especially as it relates to the next “point” release of FreeBSD, then you should
consider following FreeBSD-STABLE.</p>

<p>While it is true that security fixes also go into the FreeBSD-STABLE branch, you do
not <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">need</i></span> to track FreeBSD-STABLE to
do this. Every security advisory for FreeBSD explains how to fix the problem for the
releases it affects <a id="AEN28285" name="AEN28285" href="#FTN.AEN28285"><span
class="footnote">[1]</span></a> , and tracking an entire development branch just for
security reasons is likely to bring in a lot of unwanted changes as well.</p>

<p>Although we endeavor to ensure that the FreeBSD-STABLE branch compiles and runs at all
times, this cannot be guaranteed. In addition, while code is developed in FreeBSD-CURRENT
before including it in FreeBSD-STABLE, more people run FreeBSD-STABLE than
FreeBSD-CURRENT, so it is inevitable that bugs and corner cases will sometimes be found
in FreeBSD-STABLE that were not apparent in FreeBSD-CURRENT.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we do <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span>
recommend that you blindly track FreeBSD-STABLE, and it is particularly important that
you do not update any production servers to FreeBSD-STABLE without first thoroughly
testing the code in your development environment.</p>

<p>If you do not have the resources to do this then we recommend that you run the most
recent release of FreeBSD, and use the binary update mechanism to move from release to
release.</p>

<p>If you are installing a new system and want it to be as stable as possible, you can
simply grab the latest dated branch snapshot from <a
href="ftp://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/"
target="_top">ftp://snapshots.jp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/</a> and install it
like any other release. Or you can install the most recent FreeBSD-STABLE release from
the <a href="mirrors.html">mirror sites</a> and follow the instructions below to upgrade
your system to the most up to date FreeBSD-STABLE source code.</p>

<p>If you are already running a previous release of FreeBSD and wish to upgrade via
sources then you can easily do so from FreeBSD <a href="mirrors.html">mirror site</a>.
This can be done in one of two ways:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="cvsup.html">cvsup</a> program with the <tt
class="FILENAME">supfile</tt> named <tt class="FILENAME">stable-supfile</tt> from the
directory <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/share/examples/cvsup</tt>. This is the most
recommended method, since it allows you to grab the entire collection once and then only
what has changed from then on. Many people run <tt class="COMMAND">cvsup</tt> from <tt
class="COMMAND">cron</tt> to keep their sources up-to-date automatically. You have to
customize the sample <tt class="FILENAME">supfile</tt> above, and configure <a
href="cvsup.html">cvsup</a> for your environment.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use the <b class="APPLICATION"><a href="ctm.html">CTM</a></b> facility. If you do not
have a fast and inexpensive connection to the Internet, this is the method you should
consider using.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Essentially, if you need rapid on-demand access to the source and communications
bandwidth is not a consideration, use <tt class="COMMAND">cvsup</tt> or <tt
class="COMMAND">ftp</tt>. Otherwise, use <b class="APPLICATION">CTM</b>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Before compiling FreeBSD-STABLE, read the <tt class="FILENAME">Makefile</tt> in <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src</tt> carefully. You should at least <a
