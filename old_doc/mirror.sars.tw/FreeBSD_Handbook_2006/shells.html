<h1 class="SECT1"><a id="SHELLS" name="SHELLS">3.9 Shells</a></h1>

<p>In FreeBSD, a lot of everyday work is done in a command line interface called a shell.
A shell's main job is to take commands from the input channel and execute them. A lot of
shells also have built in functions to help everyday tasks such as file management, file
globbing, command line editing, command macros, and environment variables. FreeBSD comes
with a set of shells, such as <tt class="COMMAND">sh</tt>, the Bourne Shell, and <tt
class="COMMAND">tcsh</tt>, the improved C-shell. Many other shells are available from the
FreeBSD Ports Collection, such as <tt class="COMMAND">zsh</tt> and <tt
class="COMMAND">bash</tt>.</p>

<p>Which shell do you use? It is really a matter of taste. If you are a C programmer you
might feel more comfortable with a C-like shell such as <tt class="COMMAND">tcsh</tt>. If
you have come from Linux or are new to a <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg; command
line interface you might try <tt class="COMMAND">bash</tt>. The point is that each shell
has unique properties that may or may not work with your preferred working environment,
and that you have a choice of what shell to use.</p>

<p>One common feature in a shell is filename completion. Given the typing of the first
few letters of a command or filename, you can usually have the shell automatically
complete the rest of the command or filename by hitting the <b class="KEYCAP">Tab</b> key
on the keyboard. Here is an example. Suppose you have two files called <tt
class="FILENAME">foobar</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">foo.bar</tt>. You want to delete
<tt class="FILENAME">foo.bar</tt>. So what you would type on the keyboard is: <tt
class="COMMAND">rm fo[<b class="KEYCAP">Tab</b>].[<b class="KEYCAP">Tab</b>]</tt>.</p>

<p>The shell would print out <tt class="COMMAND">rm foo[BEEP].bar</tt>.</p>

<p>The [BEEP] is the console bell, which is the shell telling me it was unable to totally
complete the filename because there is more than one match. Both <tt
class="FILENAME">foobar</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">foo.bar</tt> start with <tt
class="LITERAL">fo</tt>, but it was able to complete to <tt class="LITERAL">foo</tt>. If
you type in <tt class="LITERAL">.</tt>, then hit <b class="KEYCAP">Tab</b> again, the
shell would be able to fill in the rest of the filename for you.</p>

<p>Another feature of the shell is the use of environment variables. Environment
variables are a variable key pair stored in the shell's environment space. This space can
be read by any program invoked by the shell, and thus contains a lot of program
configuration. Here is a list of common environment variables and what they mean:</p>

<div class="INFORMALTABLE"><a id="AEN4988" name="AEN4988"></a>
<table border="0" frame="void" width="100%" class="CALSTABLE">

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><tt class="ENVAR">USER</tt></td>
<td>Current logged in user's name.</td>

terminal.</td>
</tr>

functions.</td>

<tr>
<td><tt class="ENVAR">MANPATH</tt></td>
<td>Colon separated list of directories to search for manual pages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Setting an environment variable differs somewhat from shell to shell. For example, in
the C-Style shells such as <tt class="COMMAND">tcsh</tt> and <tt
class="COMMAND">csh</tt>, you would use <tt class="COMMAND">setenv</tt> to set
environment variables. Under Bourne shells such as <tt class="COMMAND">sh</tt> and <tt
class="COMMAND">bash</tt>, you would use <tt class="COMMAND">export</tt> to set your
current environment variables. For example, to set or modify the <tt
class="ENVAR">EDITOR</tt> environment variable, under <tt class="COMMAND">csh</tt> or <tt
class="COMMAND">tcsh</tt> a command like this would set <tt class="ENVAR">EDITOR</tt> to
<tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local/bin/emacs</tt>:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/emacs</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Under Bourne shells:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">export EDITOR="/usr/local/bin/emacs"</kbd>
</pre>

<p>You can also make most shells expand the environment variable by placing a <tt
class="LITERAL">$</tt> character in front of it on the command line. For example, <tt
class="COMMAND">echo $TERM</tt> would print out whatever <tt class="ENVAR">$TERM</tt> is
set to, because the shell expands <tt class="ENVAR">$TERM</tt> and passes it on to <tt
class="COMMAND">echo</tt>.</p>

<p>Shells treat a lot of special characters, called meta-characters as special
representations of data. The most common one is the <tt class="LITERAL">*</tt> character,
which represents any number of characters in a filename. These special meta-characters
can be used to do filename globbing. For example, typing in <tt class="COMMAND">echo
*</tt> is almost the same as typing in <tt class="COMMAND">ls</tt> because the shell
takes all the files that match <tt class="LITERAL">*</tt> and puts them on the command
line for <tt class="COMMAND">echo</tt> to see.</p>

<p>To prevent the shell from interpreting these special characters, they can be escaped
from the shell by putting a backslash (<tt class="LITERAL">\</tt>) character in front of
them. <tt class="COMMAND">echo $TERM</tt> prints whatever your terminal is set to. <tt
class="COMMAND">echo \$TERM</tt> prints <tt class="ENVAR">$TERM</tt> as is.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="CHANGING-SHELLS" name="CHANGING-SHELLS">3.9.1 Changing Your
Shell</a></h2>

<p>The easiest way to change your shell is to use the <tt class="COMMAND">chsh</tt>
command. Running <tt class="COMMAND">chsh</tt> will place you into the editor that is in
your <tt class="ENVAR">EDITOR</tt> environment variable; if it is not set, you will be
placed in <tt class="COMMAND">vi</tt>. Change the “Shell:” line accordingly.</p>

<p>You can also give <tt class="COMMAND">chsh</tt> the <code class="OPTION">-s</code>
option; this will set your shell for you, without requiring you to enter an editor. For
example, if you wanted to change your shell to <tt class="COMMAND">bash</tt>, the
following should do the trick:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash</kbd>
</pre>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> The shell that you wish to use <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> be present in the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/shells</tt>
file. If you have installed a shell from the <a href="ports.html">ports collection</a>,
then this should have been done for you already. If you installed the shell by hand, you
must do this.</p>

<p>For example, if you installed <tt class="COMMAND">bash</tt> by hand and placed it into
<tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local/bin</tt>, you would want to:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">echo &quot;/usr/local/bin/bash&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/shells</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Then rerun <tt class="COMMAND">chsh</tt>.</p>
