Configuration File</a></h1>

<i class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Updated for FreeBSD 5.X by</span> Joel
Dahl.</i> 

<p>The general format of a configuration file is quite simple. Each line contains a
keyword and one or more arguments. For simplicity, most lines only contain one argument.
Anything following a <tt class="LITERAL">#</tt> is considered a comment and ignored. The
following sections describe each keyword, in the order they are listed in <tt
class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt>. <a id="KERNELCONFIG-OPTIONS"
name="KERNELCONFIG-OPTIONS"></a> For an exhaustive list of architecture dependent options
and devices, see the <tt class="FILENAME">NOTES</tt> file in the same directory as <tt
class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt>. For architecture independent options, see <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src/sys/conf/NOTES</tt>.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> <tt class="FILENAME">NOTES</tt> does not exist in FreeBSD&nbsp;4.X.
Instead, see the <tt class="FILENAME">LINT</tt> file for detailed explanations of options
and devices in <tt class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt>. <tt class="FILENAME">LINT</tt> served
two purposes in 4.X: to provide a reference for choosing kernel options when building a
custom kernel, and to provide a kernel configuration with as many tweakable options
tweaked to non-default values as possible. The reason behind this was that such a
configuration helped (and still does) a lot when testing new code and changes to existing
code that may cause conflicts with other parts of the kernel. However, the kernel
configuration framework went through some heavy changes in 5.X; one example of this is
that the driver configuration options were moved to a <tt class="LITERAL">hints</tt> file
so that they could be changed and loaded dynamically at boot time, and <tt
class="FILENAME">LINT</tt> could not contain those hints anymore. For this and other
reasons, the <tt class="FILENAME">LINT</tt> file was renamed to <tt
class="FILENAME">NOTES</tt> and retained mostly the first reason for its existence:
documenting the available options for user convenience.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD 5.X and later versions you can still generate a buildable <tt
class="FILENAME">LINT</tt> file by typing:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">cd /usr/src/sys/<tt
class="REPLACEABLE"><i>i386</i></tt>/conf &#38;&#38; make LINT</kbd>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The following is an example of the <tt class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> kernel
configuration file with various additional comments where needed for clarity. This
example should match your copy in <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/src/sys/<tt
class="REPLACEABLE"><i>i386</i></tt>/conf/GENERIC</tt> fairly closely.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
machine        i386
</pre>

<p>This is the machine architecture. It must be either <tt class="LITERAL">alpha</tt>,
<tt class="LITERAL">amd64</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">i386</tt>, <tt
class="LITERAL">ia64</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">pc98</tt>, <tt
class="LITERAL">powerpc</tt>, or <tt class="LITERAL">sparc64</tt>.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
cpu          I486_CPU
cpu          I586_CPU
cpu          I686_CPU
</pre>

<p>The above option specifies the type of CPU you have in your system. You may have
multiple instances of the CPU line (if, for example, you are not sure whether you should
use <tt class="LITERAL">I586_CPU</tt> or <tt class="LITERAL">I686_CPU</tt>), but for a
custom kernel it is best to specify only the CPU you have. If you are unsure of your CPU
type, you can check the <tt class="FILENAME">/var/run/dmesg.boot</tt> file to view your
boot messages.</p>

<p>Support for <tt class="LITERAL">I386_CPU</tt> is still provided in the source of
FreeBSD, but it is disabled by default in both -STABLE and -CURRENT. This means that to
install FreeBSD with a 386-class cpu, you now have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Install an older FreeBSD release and rebuild from source as described in <a
href="kernelconfig-building.html">Section 8.3</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Build the userland and kernel on a newer machine and install on the 386 using the
precompiled <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/obj</tt> files (see <a
href="small-lan.html">Section 21.5</a> for details).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Roll your own release of FreeBSD which includes <tt class="LITERAL">I386_CPU</tt>
support in the kernels of the installation CD-ROM.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these options is probably the easiest of all, but you will need a lot of
disk space which, on a 386-class machine, may be difficult to find.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ident          GENERIC
</pre>

<p>This is the identification of the kernel. You should change this to whatever you named
your kernel, i.e. <tt class="LITERAL">MYKERNEL</tt> if you have followed the instructions
of the previous examples. The value you put in the <tt class="LITERAL">ident</tt> string
will print when you boot up the kernel, so it is useful to give the new kernel a
different name if you want to keep it separate from your usual kernel (e.g., you want to
build an experimental kernel).</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
#To statically compile in device wiring instead of /boot/device.hints
#hints          "GENERIC.hints"         # Default places to look for devices.
</pre>

<p>In FreeBSD 5.X and newer versions the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=device.hints&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+6-current">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">device.hints</span>(5)</span></a>
is used to configure options of the device drivers. The default location that <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=loader&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">loader</span>(8)</span></a> will check
at boot time is <tt class="FILENAME">/boot/device.hints</tt>. Using the <tt
class="LITERAL">hints</tt> option you can compile these hints statically into your
kernel. Then there is no need to create a <tt class="FILENAME">device.hints</tt> file in
<tt class="FILENAME">/boot</tt>.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
#makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols
</pre>

<p>The normal build process of FreeBSD does not include debugging information when
building the kernel and strips most symbols after the resulting kernel is linked, to save
some space at the install location. If you are going to do tests of kernels in the
-CURRENT branch or develop changes of your own for the FreeBSD kernel, you might want to
uncomment this line. It will enable the use of the <code class="OPTION">-g</code> option
which enables debugging information when passed to <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gcc&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">gcc</span>(1)</span></a>. The same can
be accomplished by the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=config&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">config</span>(8)</span></a> <code
class="OPTION">-g</code> option, if you are using the “traditional” way for building
your kernels (see <a href="kernelconfig-building.html">Section 8.3</a> for more
information).</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SCHED_4BSD         # 4BSD scheduler
</pre>

<p>The traditional scheduler for FreeBSD. Depending on your system's workload, you may
gain performance by using the new ULE scheduler for FreeBSD that has been designed
specially for SMP, but works just fine on UP systems too. If you wish to try it out,
replace <tt class="LITERAL">SCHED_4BSD</tt> with <tt class="LITERAL">SCHED_ULE</tt> in
your configuration file.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          INET              # InterNETworking
</pre>

<p>Networking support. Leave this in, even if you do not plan to be connected to a
network. Most programs require at least loopback networking (i.e., making network
connections within your PC), so this is essentially mandatory.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          INET6             # IPv6 communications protocols
</pre>

<p>This enables the IPv6 communication protocols.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          FFS               # Berkeley Fast Filesystem
</pre>

<p>This is the basic hard drive file system. Leave it in if you boot from the hard
disk.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SOFTUPDATES       # Enable FFS Soft Updates support
</pre>

<p>This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel, this will help speed up write access
on the disks. Even when this functionality is provided by the kernel, it must be turned
on for specific disks. Review the output from <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mount</span>(8)</span></a> to see if
Soft Updates is enabled for your system disks. If you do not see the <tt
class="LITERAL">soft-updates</tt> option then you will need to activate it using the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tunefs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tunefs</span>(8)</span></a> (for
existing file systems) or <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=newfs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">newfs</span>(8)</span></a> (for new file
systems) commands.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          UFS_ACL           # Support for access control lists
</pre>

<p>This option, present only in FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X, enables kernel support for access
control lists. This relies on the use of extended attributes and <acronym
class="ACRONYM">UFS2</acronym>, and the feature is described in detail in <a
href="fs-acl.html">Section 14.12</a>. <acronym class="ACRONYM">ACL</acronym>s are enabled
by default and should not be disabled in the kernel if they have been used previously on
a file system, as this will remove the access control lists, changing the way files are
protected in unpredictable ways.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          UFS_DIRHASH       # Improve performance on big directories
</pre>

<p>This option includes functionality to speed up disk operations on large directories,
at the expense of using additional memory. You would normally keep this for a large
server, or interactive workstation, and remove it if you are using FreeBSD on a smaller
system where memory is at a premium and disk access speed is less important, such as a
firewall.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          MD_ROOT           # MD is a potential root device
</pre>

<p>This option enables support for a memory backed virtual disk used as a root
device.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          NFSCLIENT         # Network Filesystem Client
options          NFSSERVER         # Network Filesystem Server
options          NFS_ROOT          # NFS usable as /, requires NFSCLIENT
</pre>

<p>The network file system. Unless you plan to mount partitions from a <span
class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg; file server over TCP/IP, you can comment these
out.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          MSDOSFS           # MSDOS Filesystem
</pre>

<p>The <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg; file system. Unless you plan to mount a
DOS formatted hard drive partition at boot time, you can safely comment this out. It will
be automatically loaded the first time you mount a DOS partition, as described above.
Also, the excellent <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/emulators/mtools/pkg-descr"><tt
class="FILENAME">emulators/mtools</tt></a> software allows you to access DOS floppies
without having to mount and unmount them (and does not require <tt
class="LITERAL">MSDOSFS</tt> at all).</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          CD9660            # ISO 9660 Filesystem
</pre>

<p>The ISO 9660 file system for CDROMs. Comment it out if you do not have a CDROM drive
or only mount data CDs occasionally (since it will be dynamically loaded the first time
you mount a data CD). Audio CDs do not need this file system.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          PROCFS            # Process filesystem
</pre>

<p>The process file system. This is a “pretend” file system mounted on <tt
class="FILENAME">/proc</tt> which allows programs like <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ps&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ps</span>(1)</span></a> to give you more
information on what processes are running. In FreeBSD 5.X and above, use of <tt
class="LITERAL">PROCFS</tt> is not required under most circumstances, as most debugging
and monitoring tools have been adapted to run without <tt class="LITERAL">PROCFS</tt>:
unlike in FreeBSD 4.X, new installations of FreeBSD 5.X will not mount the process file
system by default. In addition, 6.X-CURRENT kernels making use of <tt
class="LITERAL">PROCFS</tt> must now also include support for <tt
class="LITERAL">PSEUDOFS</tt>:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          PSEUDOFS          # Pseudo-filesystem framework
</pre>

<p><tt class="LITERAL">PSEUDOFS</tt> is not available in FreeBSD 4.X.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          GEOM_GPT          # GUID Partition Tables.
</pre>

<p>This option brings the ability to have a large number of partitions on a single
disk.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          COMPAT_43         # Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP THIS!]
</pre>

<p>Compatibility with 4.3BSD. Leave this in; some programs will act strangely if you
comment this out.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          COMPAT_FREEBSD4   # Compatible with FreeBSD4
</pre>

<p>This option is required on FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X <span class="TRADEMARK">i386</span>&#8482;
and Alpha systems to support applications compiled on older versions of FreeBSD that use
older system call interfaces. It is recommended that this option be used on all <span
class="TRADEMARK">i386</span> and Alpha systems that may run older applications;
platforms that gained support only in 5.X, such as ia64 and <span
class="TRADEMARK">Sparc64</span>&reg;, do not require this option.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SCSI_DELAY=15000  # Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI
</pre>

<p>This causes the kernel to pause for 15 seconds before probing each SCSI device in your
system. If you only have IDE hard drives, you can ignore this, otherwise you will
probably want to lower this number, perhaps to 5 seconds, to speed up booting. Of course,
if you do this and FreeBSD has trouble recognizing your SCSI devices, you will have to
raise it again.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          KTRACE            # ktrace(1) support
</pre>

<p>This enables kernel process tracing, which is useful in debugging.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SYSVSHM           # SYSV-style shared memory
</pre>

<p>This option provides for System&nbsp;V shared memory. The most common use of this is
the XSHM extension in X, which many graphics-intensive programs will automatically take
advantage of for extra speed. If you use X, you will definitely want to include this.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SYSVMSG           # SYSV-style message queues
</pre>

<p>Support for System&nbsp;V messages. This option only adds a few hundred bytes to the
kernel.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          SYSVSEM           # SYSV-style semaphores
</pre>

<p>Support for System&nbsp;V semaphores. Less commonly used but only adds a few hundred
bytes to the kernel.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> The <code class="OPTION">-p</code> option of the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipcs&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ipcs</span>(1)</span></a> command will
list any processes using each of these System&nbsp;V facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options         _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING # POSIX P1003_1B real-time extensions
</pre>

<p>Real-time extensions added in the 1993 <span class="TRADEMARK">POSIX</span>&reg;.
Certain applications in the Ports Collection use these (such as <b
class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">StarOffice</span>&#8482;</b>).</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          KBD_INSTALL_CDEV  # install a CDEV entry in /dev
</pre>

<p>This option is related to the keyboard. It installs a CDEV entry in <tt
class="FILENAME">/dev</tt>.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          AHC_REG_PRETTY_PRINT     # Print register bitfields in debug
                                          # output.  Adds ~128k to driver.
options          AHD_REG_PRETTY_PRINT     # Print register bitfields in debug
                                          # output.  Adds ~215k to driver.
</pre>

<p>This helps debugging by printing easier register definitions for reading.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options          ADAPTIVE_GIANT    # Giant mutex is adaptive.
</pre>

<p>Giant is the name of a mutual exclusion mechanism (a sleep mutex) that protects a
large set of kernel resources. Today, this is an unacceptable performance bottleneck
which is actively being replaced with locks that protect individual resources. The <tt
class="LITERAL">ADAPTIVE_GIANT</tt> option causes Giant to be included in the set of
mutexes adaptively spun on. That is, when a thread wants to lock the Giant mutex, but it
is already locked by a thread on another CPU, the first thread will keep running and wait
for the lock to be released. Normally, the thread would instead go back to sleep and wait
for its next chance to run. If you are not sure, leave this in.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device          apic               # I/O APIC
</pre>

<p>The apic device enables the use of the I/O APIC for interrupt delivery. The apic
device can be used in both UP and SMP kernels, but is required for SMP kernels. Add <tt
class="LITERAL">options SMP</tt> to include support for multiple processors.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device          isa
</pre>

<p>All PCs supported by FreeBSD have one of these. Do not remove this, even if you have
no ISA slots. If you have an IBM PS/2 (Micro Channel Architecture) system, FreeBSD
provides only limited support at this time. For more information about the MCA support,
see <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/NOTES</tt>.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device          eisa
</pre>

<p>Include this if you have an EISA motherboard. This enables auto-detection and
configuration support for all devices on the EISA bus.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device          pci
</pre>

<p>Include this if you have a PCI motherboard. This enables auto-detection of PCI cards
and gatewaying from the PCI to ISA bus.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
# Floppy drives

<p>Large memory configuration machines require access to more than the 4 gigabyte limit

this limitation, Intel added support for 36-bit physical address space access in the

<p>The Physical Address Extension (<acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym>) capability of
the <span class="TRADEMARK">Intel</span>&reg; <span class="TRADEMARK">Pentium</span> Pro
and later CPUs allows memory configurations of up to 64 gigabytes. FreeBSD provides
support for this capability via the <code class="OPTION">PAE</code> kernel configuration
option, available in the 4.X series of FreeBSD beginning with 4.9-RELEASE and in the 5.X
series of FreeBSD beginning with 5.1-RELEASE. Due to the limitations of the Intel memory
architecture, no distinction is made for memory above or below 4 gigabytes. Memory
allocated above 4 gigabytes is simply added to the pool of available memory.</p>

<p>To enable <acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> support in the kernel, simply add the

noted, that the <acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> support in FreeBSD has not
received wide testing, and should be considered beta quality compared to other stable
features of FreeBSD.</p>

</div>

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> support in FreeBSD has a few limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A process is not able to access more than 4 gigabytes of VM space.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">KLD</acronym> modules cannot be loaded into a <acronym
class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> enabled kernel, due to the differences in the build
framework of a module and the kernel.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Device drivers that do not use the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bus_dma&amp;sektion=9"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">bus_dma</span>(9)</span></a> interface
will cause data corruption in a <acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> enabled kernel and
are not recommended for use. For this reason, the <tt class="FILENAME">PAE</tt> kernel
configuration file is provided in FreeBSD 5.X, which excludes all drivers not known to
work in a <acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> enabled kernel.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some system tunables determine memory resource usage by the amount of available
physical memory. Such tunables can unnecessarily over-allocate due to the large memory
nature of a <acronym class="ACRONYM">PAE</acronym> system. One such example is the <code
class="OPTION">kern.maxvnodes</code> sysctl, which controls the maximum number of vnodes
allowed in the kernel. It is advised to adjust this and other such tunables to a
reasonable value.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It might be necessary to increase the kernel virtual address (<acronym
class="ACRONYM">KVA</acronym>) space or to reduce the amount of specific kernel resource
that is heavily used (see above) in order to avoid <acronym class="ACRONYM">KVA</acronym>
exhaustion. The <code class="OPTION">KVA_PAGES</code> kernel option can be used for
increasing the <acronym class="ACRONYM">KVA</acronym> space.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For performance and stability concerns, it is advised to consult the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&amp;sektion=7"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tuning</span>(7)</span></a> manual page.
