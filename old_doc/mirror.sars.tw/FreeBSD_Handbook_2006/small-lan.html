Machines</a></h1>

<i class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Contributed by</span> Mike Meyer.</i> 

<p>If you have multiple machines that you want to track the same source tree, then having
all of them download sources and rebuild everything seems like a waste of resources: disk
space, network bandwidth, and CPU cycles. It is, and the solution is to have one machine
do most of the work, while the rest of the machines mount that work via NFS. This section
outlines a method of doing so.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="SMALL-LAN-PRELIMINARIES" name="SMALL-LAN-PRELIMINARIES">21.5.1
Preliminaries</a></h2>

<p>First, identify a set of machines that is going to run the same set of binaries, which
we will call a <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">build set</i></span>. Each
machine can have a custom kernel, but they will be running the same userland binaries.
From that set, choose a machine to be the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">build machine</i></span>. It is going to be the machine that the world
and kernel are built on. Ideally, it should be a fast machine that has sufficient spare
CPU to run <tt class="COMMAND">make buildworld</tt> and <tt class="COMMAND">make
buildkernel</tt>. You will also want to choose a machine to be the <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">test machine</i></span>, which will test software
updates before they are put into production. This <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> be a machine that you can afford to have down for an
extended period of time. It can be the build machine, but need not be.</p>

<p>All the machines in this build set need to mount <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/obj</tt>
and <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/src</tt> from the same machine, and at the same point.
Ideally, those are on two different drives on the build machine, but they can be NFS
mounted on that machine as well. If you have multiple build sets, <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src</tt> should be on one build machine, and NFS mounted on the
rest.</p>

<p>Finally make sure that <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/make.conf</tt> on all the machines in
the build set agrees with the build machine. That means that the build machine must build
all the parts of the base system that any machine in the build set is going to install.
Also, each build machine should have its kernel name set with <tt
class="MAKEVAR">KERNCONF</tt> in <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/make.conf</tt>, and the build
machine should list them all in <tt class="MAKEVAR">KERNCONF</tt>, listing its own kernel
first. The build machine must have the kernel configuration files for each machine in <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src/sys/<tt class="REPLACEABLE"><i>arch</i></tt>/conf</tt> if it is
going to build their kernels.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN29315" name="AEN29315">21.5.2 The Base System</a></h2>

<p>Now that all that is done, you are ready to build everything. Build the kernel and
world as described in <a href="makeworld.html#MAKE-BUILDWORLD">Section 21.4.7.2</a> on
the build machine, but do not install anything. After the build has finished, go to the
test machine, and install the kernel you just built. If this machine mounts <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/src</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/obj</tt> via NFS, when you
reboot to single user you will need to enable the network and mount them. The easiest way
to do this is to boot to multi-user, then run <tt class="COMMAND">shutdown now</tt> to go
to single user mode. Once there, you can install the new kernel and world and run <tt
class="COMMAND">mergemaster</tt> just as you normally would. When done, reboot to return
to normal multi-user operations for this machine.</p>

<p>After you are certain that everything on the test machine is working properly, use the
same procedure to install the new software on each of the other machines in the build
set.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN29324" name="AEN29324">21.5.3 Ports</a></h2>

<p>The same ideas can be used for the ports tree. The first critical step is mounting <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/ports</tt> from the same machine to all the machines in the build
set. You can then set up <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/make.conf</tt> properly to share
distfiles. You should set <tt class="MAKEVAR">DISTDIR</tt> to a common shared directory
that is writable by whichever user <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> is mapped to by your
NFS mounts. Each machine should set <tt class="MAKEVAR">WRKDIRPREFIX</tt> to a local
build directory. Finally, if you are going to be building and distributing packages, you
should set <tt class="MAKEVAR">PACKAGES</tt> to a directory similar to <tt
class="MAKEVAR">DISTDIR</tt>.</p>
