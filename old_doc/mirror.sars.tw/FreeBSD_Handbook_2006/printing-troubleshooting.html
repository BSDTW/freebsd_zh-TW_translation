Troubleshooting</a></h1>

<p>After performing the simple test with <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=lptest&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">lptest</span>(1)</span></a>, you might
have gotten one of the following results instead of the correct printout:</p>

<div class="VARIABLELIST">
<dl>
<dt>It worked, after awhile; or, it did not eject a full sheet.</dt>

<dd>
<p>The printer printed the above, but it sat for awhile and did nothing. In fact, you
might have needed to press a PRINT REMAINING or FORM FEED button on the printer to get
any results to appear.</p>

<p>If this is the case, the printer was probably waiting to see if there was any more
data for your job before it printed anything. To fix this problem, you can have the text
filter send a FORM FEED character (or whatever is necessary) to the printer. This is
usually sufficient to have the printer immediately print any text remaining in its
internal buffer. It is also useful to make sure each print job ends on a full sheet, so
the next job does not start somewhere on the middle of the last page of the previous
job.</p>

<p>The following replacement for the shell script <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/local/libexec/if-simple</tt> prints a form feed after it sends the
job to the printer:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
#!/bin/sh
#
# if-simple - Simple text input filter for lpd
# Installed in /usr/local/libexec/if-simple
#
# Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.
# Writes a form feed character (\f) after printing job.

/bin/cat &amp;&amp; printf "\f" &amp;&amp; exit 0
exit 2
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>It produced the “staircase effect.”</dt>

<dd>
<p>You got the following on paper:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./01234
                "#$%&amp;'()*+,-./012345
                                 #$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456
</pre>

<p>You have become another victim of the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">staircase effect</i></span>, caused by conflicting interpretations of
what characters should indicate a new line. <span class="TRADEMARK">UNIX</span>&reg;
style operating systems use a single character: ASCII code 10, the line feed (LF). <span
class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg;, <span class="TRADEMARK">OS/2</span>&reg;, and
others uses a pair of characters, ASCII code 10 <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">and</i></span> ASCII code 13 (the carriage return or CR). Many printers
use the <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> convention for representing new-lines.</p>

<p>When you print with FreeBSD, your text used just the line feed character. The printer,
upon seeing a line feed character, advanced the paper one line, but maintained the same
horizontal position on the page for the next character to print. That is what the
carriage return is for: to move the location of the next character to print to the left
edge of the paper.</p>

<p>Here is what FreeBSD wants your printer to do:</p>

<div class="INFORMALTABLE"><a id="AEN13069" name="AEN13069"></a>
<table border="0" frame="void" width="90%" class="CALSTABLE">
<col />
<col />
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Printer received CR</td>
<td>Printer prints CR</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Printer received LF</td>
<td>Printer prints CR + LF</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Here are some ways to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the printer's configuration switches or control panel to alter its interpretation
of these characters. Check your printer's manual to find out how to do this.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> If you boot your system into other operating systems besides FreeBSD, you
may have to <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">reconfigure</i></span> the printer
to use a an interpretation for CR and LF characters that those other operating systems
use. You might prefer one of the other solutions, below.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p>Have FreeBSD's serial line driver automatically convert LF to CR+LF. Of course, this
works with printers on serial ports <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">only</i></span>. To enable this feature, use the <tt
class="LITERAL">ms#</tt> capability and set the <tt class="LITERAL">onlcr</tt> mode in
the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/printcap</tt> file for the printer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Send an <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escape code</i></span> to the
printer to have it temporarily treat LF characters differently. Consult your printer's
manual for escape codes that your printer might support. When you find the proper escape
code, modify the text filter to send the code first, then send the print job.</p>

<p>Here is an example text filter for printers that understand the Hewlett-Packard PCL
escape codes. This filter makes the printer treat LF characters as a LF and CR; then it
sends the job; then it sends a form feed to eject the last page of the job. It should
work with nearly all Hewlett Packard printers.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
#!/bin/sh
#
# hpif - Simple text input filter for lpd for HP-PCL based printers
# Installed in /usr/local/libexec/hpif
#
# Simply copies stdin to stdout.  Ignores all filter arguments.
# Tells printer to treat LF as CR+LF.  Ejects the page when done.

printf "\033&amp;k2G" &amp;&amp; cat &amp;&amp; printf "\033&amp;l0H" &amp;&amp; exit 0
exit 2
</pre>

<p>Here is an example <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/printcap</tt> from a host called <tt
class="HOSTID">orchid</tt>. It has a single printer attached to its first parallel port,
a Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si named <tt class="LITERAL">teak</tt>. It is using the above
script as its text filter:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
#
#  /etc/printcap for host orchid
#
teak|hp|laserjet|Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3Si:\
        :lp=/dev/lpt0:sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/teak:mx#0:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/hpif:
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>It overprinted each line.</dt>

<dd>
<p>The printer never advanced a line. All of the lines of text were printed on top of
each other on one line.</p>

<p>This problem is the “opposite” of the staircase effect, described above, and is much
rarer. Somewhere, the LF characters that FreeBSD uses to end a line are being treated as
CR characters to return the print location to the left edge of the paper, but not also
down a line.</p>

<p>Use the printer's configuration switches or control panel to enforce the following
interpretation of LF and CR characters:</p>

<div class="INFORMALTABLE"><a id="AEN13110" name="AEN13110"></a>
<table border="0" frame="void" width="90%" class="CALSTABLE">
<col />
<col />
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Printer receives</th>
<th>Printer prints</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CR</td>
<td>CR</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LF</td>
<td>CR + LF</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</dd>

<dt>The printer lost characters.</dt>

<dd>
<p>While printing, the printer did not print a few characters in each line. The problem
might have gotten worse as the printer ran, losing more and more characters.</p>

<p>The problem is that the printer cannot keep up with the speed at which the computer
sends data over a serial line (this problem should not occur with printers on parallel
ports). There are two ways to overcome the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the printer supports XON/XOFF flow control, have FreeBSD use it by specifying the
<tt class="LITERAL">ixon</tt> mode in the <tt class="LITERAL">ms#</tt> capability.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the printer supports carrier flow control, specify the <tt
class="LITERAL">crtscts</tt> mode in the <tt class="LITERAL">ms#</tt> capability. Make
sure the cable connecting the printer to the computer is correctly wired for carrier flow
control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>It printed garbage.</dt>

<dd>
<p>The printer printed what appeared to be random garbage, but not the desired text.</p>

<p>This is usually another symptom of incorrect communications parameters with a serial
printer. Double-check the bps rate in the <tt class="LITERAL">br</tt> capability, and the
parity setting in the <tt class="LITERAL">ms#</tt> capability; make sure the printer is
using the same settings as specified in the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/printcap</tt>
file.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Nothing happened.</dt>

<dd>
<p>If nothing happened, the problem is probably within FreeBSD and not the hardware. Add
the log file (<tt class="LITERAL">lf</tt>) capability to the entry for the printer you
are debugging in the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/printcap</tt> file. For example, here is
the entry for <tt class="LITERAL">rattan</tt>, with the <tt class="LITERAL">lf</tt>
capability:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
rattan|line|diablo|lp|Diablo 630 Line Printer:\
        :sh:sd=/var/spool/lpd/rattan:\
        :lp=/dev/lpt0:\
        :if=/usr/local/libexec/if-simple:\
        :lf=/var/log/rattan.log
</pre>

<p>Then, try printing again. Check the log file (in our example, <tt
class="FILENAME">/var/log/rattan.log</tt>) to see any error messages that might appear.
Based on the messages you see, try to correct the problem.</p>

<p>If you do not specify a <tt class="LITERAL">lf</tt> capability, <b
class="APPLICATION">LPD</b> uses <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/console</tt> as a default.</p>
