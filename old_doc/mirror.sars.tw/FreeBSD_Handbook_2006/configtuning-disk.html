<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16719" name="AEN16719">11.12.1.1 <code
class="VARNAME">vfs.vmiodirenable</code></a></h3>

<p>The <code class="VARNAME">vfs.vmiodirenable</code> sysctl variable may be set to
either 0 (off) or 1 (on); it is 1 by default. This variable controls how directories are
cached by the system. Most directories are small, using just a single fragment (typically
1&nbsp;K) in the file system and less (typically 512&nbsp;bytes) in the buffer cache.
With this variable turned off (to 0), the buffer cache will only cache a fixed number of
directories even if you have a huge amount of memory. When turned on (to 1), this sysctl
allows the buffer cache to use the VM Page Cache to cache the directories, making all the
memory available for caching directories. However, the minimum in-core memory used to
cache a directory is the physical page size (typically 4&nbsp;K) rather than 512&nbsp;
bytes. We recommend keeping this option on if you are running any services which
manipulate large numbers of files. Such services can include web caches, large mail
systems, and news systems. Keeping this option on will generally not reduce performance
even with the wasted memory but you should experiment to find out.</p>

<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16727" name="AEN16727">11.12.1.2 <code
class="VARNAME">vfs.write_behind</code></a></h3>

<p>The <code class="VARNAME">vfs.write_behind</code> sysctl variable defaults to <tt
class="LITERAL">1</tt> (on). This tells the file system to issue media writes as full
clusters are collected, which typically occurs when writing large sequential files. The
idea is to avoid saturating the buffer cache with dirty buffers when it would not benefit
I/O performance. However, this may stall processes and under certain circumstances you
may wish to turn it off.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16736" name="AEN16736">11.12.1.3 <code
class="VARNAME">vfs.hirunningspace</code></a></h3>

<p>The <code class="VARNAME">vfs.hirunningspace</code> sysctl variable determines how
much outstanding write I/O may be queued to disk controllers system-wide at any given
instance. The default is usually sufficient but on machines with lots of disks you may
want to bump it up to four or five <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">megabytes</i></span>. Note that setting too high a value (exceeding the
buffer cache's write threshold) can lead to extremely bad clustering performance. Do not
set this value arbitrarily high! Higher write values may add latency to reads occurring
at the same time.</p>

<p>There are various other buffer-cache and VM page cache related sysctls. We do not
recommend modifying these values. As of FreeBSD&nbsp;4.3, the VM system does an extremely
good job of automatically tuning itself.</p>

<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16746" name="AEN16746">11.12.1.4 <code
class="VARNAME">vm.swap_idle_enabled</code></a></h3>

<p>The <code class="VARNAME">vm.swap_idle_enabled</code> sysctl variable is useful in
large multi-user systems where you have lots of users entering and leaving the system and
lots of idle processes. Such systems tend to generate a great deal of continuous pressure
on free memory reserves. Turning this feature on and tweaking the swapout hysteresis (in
idle seconds) via <code class="VARNAME">vm.swap_idle_threshold1</code> and <code
class="VARNAME">vm.swap_idle_threshold2</code> allows you to depress the priority of
memory pages associated with idle processes more quickly then the normal pageout
algorithm. This gives a helping hand to the pageout daemon. Do not turn this option on
unless you need it, because the tradeoff you are making is essentially pre-page memory
sooner rather than later; thus eating more swap and disk bandwidth. In a small system
this option will have a determinable effect but in a large system that is already doing
moderate paging this option allows the VM system to stage whole processes into and out of
memory easily.</p>

<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16756" name="AEN16756">11.12.1.5 <code
class="VARNAME">hw.ata.wc</code></a></h3>

<p>FreeBSD&nbsp;4.3 flirted with turning off IDE write caching. This reduced write
bandwidth to IDE disks but was considered necessary due to serious data consistency
issues introduced by hard drive vendors. The problem is that IDE drives lie about when a
write completes. With IDE write caching turned on, IDE hard drives not only write data to
disk out of order, but will sometimes delay writing some blocks indefinitely when under
heavy disk loads. A crash or power failure may cause serious file system corruption.
FreeBSD's default was changed to be safe. Unfortunately, the result was such a huge
performance loss that we changed write caching back to on by default after the release.
You should check the default on your system by observing the <code
class="VARNAME">hw.ata.wc</code> sysctl variable. If IDE write caching is turned off, you
can turn it back on by setting the kernel variable back to 1. This must be done from the
boot loader at boot time. Attempting to do it after the kernel boots will have no
effect.</p>

<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">SCSI_DELAY</tt> kernel config may be used to reduce system

<p>The <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tunefs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tunefs</span>(8)</span></a> program can
be used to fine-tune a file system. This program has many different options, but for now
we are only concerned with toggling Soft Updates on and off, which is done by:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">tunefs -n enable /filesystem</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">tunefs -n disable /filesystem</kbd>
</pre>

<p>A filesystem cannot be modified with <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tunefs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tunefs</span>(8)</span></a> while it is
mounted. A good time to enable Soft Updates is before any partitions have been mounted,
in single-user mode.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> As of FreeBSD&nbsp;4.5, it is possible to enable Soft Updates at

</div>

<p>Soft Updates drastically improves meta-data performance, mainly file creation and
deletion, through the use of a memory cache. We recommend to use Soft Updates on all of
your file systems. There are two downsides to Soft Updates that you should be aware of:
First, Soft Updates guarantees filesystem consistency in the case of a crash but could
very easily be several seconds (even a minute!) behind updating the physical disk. If
your system crashes you may lose more work than otherwise. Secondly, Soft Updates delays
the freeing of filesystem blocks. If you have a filesystem (such as the root filesystem)
which is almost full, performing a major update, such as <tt class="COMMAND">make
installworld</tt>, can cause the filesystem to run out of space and the update to
fail.</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN16814" name="AEN16814">11.12.2.1 More Details about Soft
Updates</a></h3>

<p>There are two traditional approaches to writing a file systems meta-data back to disk.
(Meta-data updates are updates to non-content data like inodes or directories.)</p>

<p>Historically, the default behavior was to write out meta-data updates synchronously.
If a directory had been changed, the system waited until the change was actually written
to disk. The file data buffers (file contents) were passed through the buffer cache and
backed up to disk later on asynchronously. The advantage of this implementation is that
it operates safely. If there is a failure during an update, the meta-data are always in a
consistent state. A file is either created completely or not at all. If the data blocks
of a file did not find their way out of the buffer cache onto the disk by the time of the
crash, <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> is able to
recognize this and repair the filesystem by setting the file length to 0. Additionally,
the implementation is clear and simple. The disadvantage is that meta-data changes are
slow. An <tt class="COMMAND">rm -r</tt>, for instance, touches all the files in a
directory sequentially, but each directory change (deletion of a file) will be written
synchronously to the disk. This includes updates to the directory itself, to the inode
table, and possibly to indirect blocks allocated by the file. Similar considerations
apply for unrolling large hierarchies (<tt class="COMMAND">tar -x</tt>).</p>

<p>The second case is asynchronous meta-data updates. This is the default for
Linux/ext2fs and <tt class="COMMAND">mount -o async</tt> for *BSD ufs. All meta-data
updates are simply being passed through the buffer cache too, that is, they will be
intermixed with the updates of the file content data. The advantage of this
implementation is there is no need to wait until each meta-data update has been written
to disk, so all operations which cause huge amounts of meta-data updates work much faster
than in the synchronous case. Also, the implementation is still clear and simple, so
there is a low risk for bugs creeping into the code. The disadvantage is that there is no
guarantee at all for a consistent state of the filesystem. If there is a failure during
an operation that updated large amounts of meta-data (like a power failure, or someone
pressing the reset button), the filesystem will be left in an unpredictable state. There
is no opportunity to examine the state of the filesystem when the system comes up again;
the data blocks of a file could already have been written to the disk while the updates
of the inode table or the associated directory were not. It is actually impossible to
implement a <tt class="COMMAND">fsck</tt> which is able to clean up the resulting chaos
(because the necessary information is not available on the disk). If the filesystem has
been damaged beyond repair, the only choice is to use <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=newfs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">newfs</span>(8)</span></a> on it and
restore it from backup.</p>

<p>The usual solution for this problem was to implement <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">dirty region logging</i></span>, which is also referred to as <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">journaling</i></span>, although that term is not
used consistently and is occasionally applied to other forms of transaction logging as
well. Meta-data updates are still written synchronously, but only into a small region of
the disk. Later on they will be moved to their proper location. Because the logging area
is a small, contiguous region on the disk, there are no long distances for the disk heads
to move, even during heavy operations, so these operations are quicker than synchronous
updates. Additionally the complexity of the implementation is fairly limited, so the risk
of bugs being present is low. A disadvantage is that all meta-data are written twice
(once into the logging region and once to the proper location) so for normal work, a
performance “pessimization” might result. On the other hand, in case of a crash, all
pending meta-data operations can be quickly either rolled-back or completed from the
logging area after the system comes up again, resulting in a fast filesystem startup.</p>

<p>Kirk McKusick, the developer of Berkeley FFS, solved this problem with Soft Updates:
all pending meta-data updates are kept in memory and written out to disk in a sorted
sequence (“ordered meta-data updates”). This has the effect that, in case of heavy
meta-data operations, later updates to an item “catch” the earlier ones if the earlier
ones are still in memory and have not already been written to disk. So all operations on,
say, a directory are generally performed in memory before the update is written to disk
(the data blocks are sorted according to their position so that they will not be on the
disk ahead of their meta-data). If the system crashes, this causes an implicit “log
rewind”: all operations which did not find their way to the disk appear as if they had
never happened. A consistent filesystem state is maintained that appears to be the one of
30 to 60 seconds earlier. The algorithm used guarantees that all resources in use are
marked as such in their appropriate bitmaps: blocks and inodes. After a crash, the only
resource allocation error that occurs is that resources are marked as “used” which are
actually “free”. <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> recognizes
this situation, and frees the resources that are no longer used. It is safe to ignore the
dirty state of the filesystem after a crash by forcibly mounting it with <tt
class="COMMAND">mount -f</tt>. In order to free resources that may be unused, <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fsck</span>(8)</span></a> needs to be
run at a later time. This is the idea behind the <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">background fsck</i></span>: at system startup time, only a <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">snapshot</i></span> of the filesystem is recorded.
The <tt class="COMMAND">fsck</tt> can be run later on. All file systems can then be
mounted “dirty”, so the system startup proceeds in multiuser mode. Then, background <tt
class="COMMAND">fsck</tt>s will be scheduled for all file systems where this is required,
to free resources that may be unused. (File systems that do not use Soft Updates still
need the usual foreground <tt class="COMMAND">fsck</tt> though.)</p>

<p>The advantage is that meta-data operations are nearly as fast as asynchronous updates
(i.e. faster than with <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">logging</i></span>,
which has to write the meta-data twice). The disadvantages are the complexity of the code
(implying a higher risk for bugs in an area that is highly sensitive regarding loss of
user data), and a higher memory consumption. Additionally there are some idiosyncrasies
one has to get used to. After a crash, the state of the filesystem appears to be somewhat
“older”. In situations where the standard synchronous approach would have caused some
zero-length files to remain after the <tt class="COMMAND">fsck</tt>, these files do not
exist at all with a Soft Updates filesystem because neither the meta-data nor the file
contents have ever been written to disk. Disk space is not released until the updates
have been written to disk, which may take place some time after running <tt
class="COMMAND">rm</tt>. This may cause problems when installing large amounts of data on
a filesystem that does not have enough free space to hold all the files twice.</p>
