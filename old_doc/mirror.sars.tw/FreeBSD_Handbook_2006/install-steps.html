<p>Your first task is to allocate disk space for FreeBSD, and label that space so that <b
class="APPLICATION">sysinstall</b> can prepare it. In order to do this you need to know
how FreeBSD expects to find information on the disk.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALL-DRIVE-BIOS-NUMBERING"
name="INSTALL-DRIVE-BIOS-NUMBERING">2.5.1 BIOS 磁碟機編號</a></h2>

<p>Before you install and configure FreeBSD on your system, there is an important subject
that you should be aware of, especially if you have multiple hard drives.</p>

<p>In a PC running a BIOS-dependent operating system such as <span
class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg; or <span
class="TRADEMARK">Microsoft</span>&reg;&nbsp;<span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>&reg;,
the BIOS is able to abstract the normal disk drive order, and the operating system goes
along with the change. This allows the user to boot from a disk drive other than the
so-called “primary master”. This is especially convenient for some users who have found
that the simplest and cheapest way to keep a system backup is to buy an identical second
hard drive, and perform routine copies of the first drive to the second drive using <b
class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">Ghost</span>&reg;</b> or <b
class="APPLICATION">XCOPY</b> . Then, if the first drive fails, or is attacked by a
virus, or is scribbled upon by an operating system defect, he can easily recover by
instructing the BIOS to logically swap the drives. It is like switching the cables on the
drives, but without having to open the case.</p>

<p>More expensive systems with SCSI controllers often include BIOS extensions which allow
the SCSI drives to be re-ordered in a similar fashion for up to seven drives.</p>

<p>A user who is accustomed to taking advantage of these features may become surprised
when the results with FreeBSD are not as expected. FreeBSD does not use the BIOS, and
does not know the “logical BIOS drive mapping”. This can lead to very perplexing
situations, especially when drives are physically identical in geometry, and have also
been made as data clones of one another.</p>

<p>When using FreeBSD, always restore the BIOS to natural drive numbering before
installing FreeBSD, and then leave it that way. If you need to switch drives around, then
do so, but do it the hard way, and open the case and move the jumpers and cables.</p>

<p><b>範例：Bill 及 Fred 的安裝歷險</b></p>

<p>Bill breaks-down an older Wintel box to make another FreeBSD box for Fred. Bill
installs a single SCSI drive as SCSI unit zero and installs FreeBSD on it.</p>

<p>Fred begins using the system, but after several days notices that the older SCSI drive
is reporting numerous soft errors and reports this fact to Bill.</p>

<p>After several more days, Bill decides it is time to address the situation, so he grabs
an identical SCSI drive from the disk drive “archive” in the back room. An initial
surface scan indicates that this drive is functioning well, so Bill installs this drive
as SCSI unit four and makes an image copy from drive zero to drive four. Now that the new
drive is installed and functioning nicely, Bill decides that it is a good idea to start
using it, so he uses features in the SCSI BIOS to re-order the disk drives so that the
system boots from SCSI unit four. FreeBSD boots and runs just fine.</p>

<p>Fred continues his work for several days, and soon Bill and Fred decide that it is
time for a new adventure -- time to upgrade to a newer version of FreeBSD. Bill removes
SCSI unit zero because it was a bit flaky and replaces it with another identical disk
drive from the “archive”. Bill then installs the new version of FreeBSD onto the new
SCSI unit zero using Fred's magic Internet FTP floppies. The installation goes well.</p>

<p>Fred uses the new version of FreeBSD for a few days, and certifies that it is good
enough for use in the engineering department. It is time to copy all of his work from the
old version. So Fred mounts SCSI unit four (the latest copy of the older FreeBSD
version). Fred is dismayed to find that none of his precious work is present on SCSI unit
four.</p>

<p>Where did the data go?</p>

<p>When Bill made an image copy of the original SCSI unit zero onto SCSI unit four, unit
four became the “new clone”. When Bill re-ordered the SCSI BIOS so that he could boot
from SCSI unit four, he was only fooling himself. FreeBSD was still running on SCSI unit
zero. Making this kind of BIOS change will cause some or all of the Boot and Loader code
to be fetched from the selected BIOS drive, but when the FreeBSD kernel drivers
take-over, the BIOS drive numbering will be ignored, and FreeBSD will transition back to
normal drive numbering. In the illustration at hand, the system continued to operate on
the original SCSI unit zero, and all of Fred's data was there, not on SCSI unit four. The
fact that the system appeared to be running on SCSI unit four was simply an artifact of
human expectations.</p>

<p>We are delighted to mention that no data bytes were killed or harmed in any way by our
discovery of this phenomenon. The older SCSI unit zero was retrieved from the bone pile,
and all of Fred's work was returned to him, (and now Bill knows that he can count as high
as zero).</p>

<p>Although SCSI drives were used in this illustration, the concepts apply equally to IDE
drives.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
                                 Message
 In the next menu, you will need to set up a DOS-style ("fdisk")
 partitioning scheme for your hard disk. If you simply wish to devote
 all disk space to FreeBSD (overwriting anything else that might be on
 the disk(s) selected) then use the (A)ll command to select the default

                      [ Press enter or space ]
</pre>

<p>Press <b class="KEYCAP">Enter</b> as instructed. You will then be shown a list of all
the hard drives that the kernel found when it carried out the device probes. <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-FDISK-DRIVE1">Figure 2-16</a> shows an example from a
system with two IDE disks. They have been called <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad0</tt> and <tt
class="DEVICENAME">ad2</tt>.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="SYSINSTALL-FDISK-DRIVE1" name="SYSINSTALL-FDISK-DRIVE1"></a>
<p><b>Figure 2-16. 選擇 FDisk 要分割的硬碟</b></p>

<p><img src="install/fdisk-drive1.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>You might be wondering why <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad1</tt> is not listed here. Why has
it been missed?</p>

<p>Consider what would happen if you had two IDE hard disks, one as the master on the
first IDE controller, and one as the master on the second IDE controller. If FreeBSD
numbered these as it found them, as <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad0</tt> and <tt
class="DEVICENAME">ad1</tt> then everything would work.</p>

<p>But if you then added a third disk, as the slave device on the first IDE controller,
it would now be <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad1</tt>, and the previous <tt
class="DEVICENAME">ad1</tt> would become <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad2</tt>. Because device
names (such as <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad1s1a</tt>) are used to find filesystems, you may
suddenly discover that some of your filesystems no longer appear correctly, and you would
need to change your FreeBSD configuration.</p>

<p>To work around this, the kernel can be configured to name IDE disks based on where
they are, and not the order in which they were found. With this scheme the master disk on
the second IDE controller will <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">always</i></span> be <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad2</tt>, even if there are
no <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad0</tt> or <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad1</tt> devices.</p>

<p>This configuration is the default for the FreeBSD kernel, which is why this display
shows <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad0</tt> and <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad2</tt>. The machine on
which this screenshot was taken had IDE disks on both master channels of the IDE
controllers, and no disks on the slave channels.</p>

<p>You should select the disk on which you want to install FreeBSD, and then press <span
class="GUIBUTTON">[&nbsp;OK&nbsp;]</span>. <b class="APPLICATION">FDisk</b> will start,
with a display similar to that shown in <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-FDISK1">Figure 2-17</a>.</p>

<p>The <b class="APPLICATION">FDisk</b> display is broken into three sections.</p>

<p>The first section, covering the first two lines of the display, shows details about
the currently selected disk, including its FreeBSD name, the disk geometry, and the total
size of the disk.</p>

<p>The second section shows the slices that are currently on the disk, where they start
and end, how large they are, the name FreeBSD gives them, and their description and
sub-type. This example shows two small unused slices, which are artifacts of disk layout
schemes on the PC. It also shows one large <acronym class="ACRONYM">FAT</acronym> slice,
which almost certainly appears as <tt class="DEVICENAME">C:</tt> in <span
class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> / <span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>, and an extended
slice, which may contain other drive letters for <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> /
<span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>.</p>

<p>The third section shows the commands that are available in <b
class="APPLICATION">FDisk</b>.</p>

<p>What you do now will depend on how you want to slice up your disk.</p>

<p>If you want to use FreeBSD for the entire disk (which will delete all the other data
on this disk when you confirm that you want <b class="APPLICATION">sysinstall</b> to
continue later in the installation process) then you can press <b class="KEYCAP">A</b>,
which corresponds to the <span class="GUIMENUITEM">Use Entire Disk</span> option. The
existing slices will be removed, and replaced with a small area flagged as <tt
class="LITERAL">unused</tt> (again, an artifact of PC disk layout), and then one large
slice for FreeBSD. If you do this, then you should select the newly created FreeBSD slice
using the arrow keys, and press <b class="KEYCAP">S</b> to mark the slice as being
bootable. The screen will then look very similar to <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-FDISK2">Figure 2-18</a>. Note the <tt
class="LITERAL">A</tt> in the <tt class="LITERAL">Flags</tt> column, which indicates that
this slice is <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">active</i></span>, and will be
booted from.</p>

<p>If you will be deleting an existing slice to make space for FreeBSD then you should
select the slice using the arrow keys, and then press <b class="KEYCAP">D</b>. You can
then press <b class="KEYCAP">C</b>, and be prompted for size of slice you want to create.
Enter the appropriate figure and press <b class="KEYCAP">Enter</b>. The default value in
this box represents the largest possible slice you can make, which could be the largest
contiguous block of unallocated space or the size of the entire hard disk.</p>

<p>If you have already made space for FreeBSD (perhaps by using a tool such as <b
class="APPLICATION"><span class="TRADEMARK">PartitionMagic</span>&reg;</b>) then you can
press <b class="KEYCAP">C</b> to create a new slice. Again, you will be prompted for the

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="DISKLABELEDITOR" name="DISKLABELEDITOR">2.5.5 以 <b

<p>You must now create some partitions inside each slice that you have just created.
Remember that each partition is lettered, from <tt class="LITERAL">a</tt> through to <tt
class="LITERAL">h</tt>, and that partitions <tt class="LITERAL">b</tt>, <tt
class="LITERAL">c</tt>, and <tt class="LITERAL">d</tt> have conventional meanings that
you should adhere to.</p>

<p>Certain applications can benefit from particular partition schemes, especially if you
are laying out partitions across more than one disk. However, for this, your first
FreeBSD installation, you do not need to give too much thought to how you partition the
disk. It is more important that you install FreeBSD and start learning how to use it. You
can always re-install FreeBSD to change your partition scheme when you are more familiar
with the operating system.</p>

<p>This scheme features four partitions--one for swap space, and three for
filesystems.</p>

<p>The system's swap space is kept on this partition. Choosing the right amount of swap
space can be a bit of an art. A good rule of thumb is that your swap space should be two
or three times as much as the available physical memory (RAM). You should also have at
least 64&nbsp;MB of swap, so if you have less than 32&nbsp;MB of RAM in your computer
then set the swap amount to 64&nbsp;MB.</p>

<p>&#13; If you have more than one disk then you can put swap space on each disk. FreeBSD
will then use each disk for swap, which effectively speeds up the act of swapping. In
this case, calculate the total amount of swap you need (e.g., 128&nbsp;MB), and then
divide this by the number of disks you have (e.g., two disks) to give the amount of swap
you should put on each disk, in this example, 64&nbsp;MB of swap per disk.</p>

<p>If you will be installing FreeBSD on to more than one disk then you must also create

<p>The default size shown will create a partition that takes up the rest of the slice. If
you are using the partition sizes described in the earlier example, then delete the
existing figure using <b class="KEYCAP">Backspace</b>, and then type in <kbd
class="USERINPUT">64M</kbd>, as shown in <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-LABEL-ADD2">Figure 2-24</a>. Then press <span
class="GUIBUTTON">[&nbsp;OK&nbsp;]</span>.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="SYSINSTALL-LABEL-ADD2" name="SYSINSTALL-LABEL-ADD2"></a>
<p><b>Figure 2-24. Edit Root Partition Size</b></p>

<p><img src="install/disklabel-root2.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>Having chosen the partition's size you will then be asked whether this partition will
contain a filesystem or swap space. The dialog box is shown in <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-LABEL-TYPE">Figure 2-25</a>. This first partition
will contain a filesystem, so check that <span class="GUIMENUITEM">FS</span> is selected
and press <b class="KEYCAP">Enter</b>.</p>

<p><b>Figure 2-25. Choose the Root Partition Type</b></p>

<p><img src="install/disklabel-fs.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>Finally, because you are creating a filesystem, you must tell <b
class="APPLICATION">Disklabel</b> where the filesystem is to be mounted. The dialog box
is shown in <a href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-LABEL-MOUNT">Figure 2-26</a>. The root
filesystem's mount point is <tt class="FILENAME">/</tt>, so type <kbd
class="USERINPUT">/</kbd>, and then press <b class="KEYCAP">Enter</b>.</p>

<div class="FIGURE"><a id="SYSINSTALL-LABEL-MOUNT" name="SYSINSTALL-LABEL-MOUNT"></a>
<p><b>Figure 2-26. Choose the Root Mount Point</b></p>

<p><img src="install/disklabel-root3.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>The display will then update to show you the newly created partition. You should
repeat this procedure for the other partitions. When you create the swap partition, you
will not be prompted for the filesystem mount point, as swap partitions are never
mounted. When you create the final partition, <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt>, you can
leave the suggested size as is, to use the rest of the slice.</p>

<p>Your final FreeBSD DiskLabel Editor screen will appear similar to <a
href="install-steps.html#SYSINSTALL-LABEL4">Figure 2-27</a>, although your values chosen
may be different. Press <b class="KEYCAP">Q</b> to finish.</p>
