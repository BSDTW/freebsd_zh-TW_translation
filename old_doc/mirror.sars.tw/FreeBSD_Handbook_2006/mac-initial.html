<p>With all of these new terms in mind, consider how the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework augments the security of the system as a whole.
The various security policy modules provided by the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework could be used to protect the network and file
systems, block users from accessing certain ports and sockets, and more. Perhaps the best
use of the policy modules is to blend them together, by loading several security policy
modules at a time for a multi-layered security environment. In a multi-layered security
environment, multiple policy modules are in effect to keep security in check. This is
different to a hardening policy, which typically hardens elements of a system that is
used only for specific purposes. The only downside is administrative overhead in cases of
multiple file system labels, setting network access control user by user, etc.</p>

<p>These downsides are minimal when compared to the lasting effect of the framework; for
instance, the ability to pick and choose which policies are required for a specific
configuration keeps performance overhead down. The reduction of support for unneeded
policies can increase the overall performance of the system as well as offer flexibility
of choice. A good implementation would consider the overall security requirements and
effectively implement the various security policy modules offered by the framework.</p>

<p>Thus a system utilizing <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> features should at
least guarantee that a user will not be permitted to change security attributes at will;
all user utilities, programs and scripts must work within the constraints of the access
rules provided by the selected security policy modules; and that total control of the
<acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> access rules are in the hands of the system
administrator.</p>

<p>It is the sole duty of the system administrator to carefully select the correct
security policy modules. Some environments may need to limit access control over the
network; in these cases, the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_portacl&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_portacl</span>(4)</span></a>, <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_ifoff&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_ifoff</span>(4)</span></a> and even
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_biba&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_biba</span>(4)</span></a> policy
modules might make good starting points. In other cases, strict confidentiality of file
system objects might be required. Policy modules such as <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_bsdextended&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_bsdextended</span>(4)</span></a> and
<a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_mls&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_mls</span>(4)</span></a> exist for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Policy decisions could be made based on network configuration. Perhaps only certain
users should be permitted access to facilities provided by <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4">
<span class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ssh</span>(1)</span></a> to access
the network or the Internet. The <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mac_portacl&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_portacl</span>(4)</span></a> would
be the policy module of choice for these situations. But what should be done in the case
of file systems? Should all access to certain directories be severed from other groups or
specific users? Or should we limit user or utility access to specific files by setting
certain objects as classified?</p>

<p>In the file system case, access to objects might be considered confidential to some
users, but not to others. For an example, a large development team might be broken off
into smaller groups of individuals. Developers in project A might not be permitted to
access objects written by developers in project B. Yet they might need to access objects
created by developers in project C; that is quite a situation indeed. Using the different
security policy modules provided by the <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework;
users could be divided into these groups and then given access to the appropriate areas
without fear of information leakage.</p>

<p>Thus, each security policy module has a unique way of dealing with the overall
security of a system. Module selection should be based on a well thought out security
policy. In many cases, the overall policy may need to be revised and reimplemented on the
system. Understanding the different security policy modules offered by the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework will help administrators choose the best policies
for their situations.</p>

<p>The default FreeBSD kernel does not include the option for the <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework; thus the following kernel option must be added
before trying any of the examples or information in this chapter:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options    MAC
</pre>

<p>And the kernel will require a rebuild and a reinstall.</p>

<div class="CAUTION">
<blockquote class="CAUTION">
<p><b>Caution:</b> While the various manual pages for <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> policy modules state that they may be built into the
kernel, it is possible to lock the system out of the network and more. Implementing
<acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> is much like implementing a firewall, care must be
taken to prevent being completely locked out of the system. The ability to revert back to
a previous configuration should be considered while the implementation of <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> remotely should be done with extreme caution.</p>
