<p>There may be some situations in which you need to create your own FreeBSD installation
media and/or source. This might be physical media, such as a tape, or a source that <b

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You have many machines connected to your local network, and one FreeBSD disc. You want
to create a local FTP site using the contents of the FreeBSD disc, and then have your
machines use this local FTP site instead of needing to connect to the Internet.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You have a FreeBSD disc, and FreeBSD does not recognize your CD/DVD drive, but <span

want to copy the FreeBSD installation files to a DOS partition on the same computer, and
then install FreeBSD using those files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The computer you want to install on does not have a CD/DVD drive or a network card,

<p>Use the miniinst ISO if Internet access is cheap for you. It will let you install
FreeBSD, and you can then install third party packages by downloading them using the

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN3479" name="AEN3479">2.13.3 Creating Installation
Floppies</a></h2>

<p>If you must install from floppy disk (which we suggest you do <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> do), either due to unsupported
hardware or simply because you insist on doing things the hard way, you must first
prepare some floppies for the installation.</p>

<p>At a minimum, you will need as many 1.44&nbsp;MB or 1.2&nbsp;MB floppies as it takes
to hold all the files in the <tt class="FILENAME">bin</tt> (binary distribution)
directory. If you are preparing the floppies from DOS, then they <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">must</i></span> be formatted using the <span
class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> <tt class="COMMAND">FORMAT</tt> command. If you are using
<span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>, use Explorer to format the disks (right-click on
the <tt class="DEVICENAME">A:</tt> drive, and select “Format”).</p>

<p>Do <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> trust factory
pre-formatted floppies. Format them again yourself, just to be sure. Many problems
reported by our users in the past have resulted from the use of improperly formatted
media, which is why we are making a point of it now.</p>

<p>If you are creating the floppies on another FreeBSD machine, a format is still not a
bad idea, though you do not need to put a DOS filesystem on each floppy. You can use the
<tt class="COMMAND">disklabel</tt> and <tt class="COMMAND">newfs</tt> commands to put a
UFS filesystem on them instead, as the following sequence of commands (for a 3.5"
1.44&nbsp;MB floppy) illustrates:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">fdformat -f 1440 fd0.1440</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">disklabel -w -r fd0.1440 floppy3</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">newfs -t 2 -u 18 -l 1 -i 65536 /dev/fd0</kbd>
</pre>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Use <tt class="LITERAL">fd0.1200</tt> and <tt
class="LITERAL">floppy5</tt> for 5.25" 1.2&nbsp;MB disks.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Then you can mount and write to them like any other filesystem.</p>

<p>After you have formatted the floppies, you will need to copy the files to them. The
distribution files are split into chunks conveniently sized so that five of them will fit
on a conventional 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy. Go through all your floppies, packing as many
files as will fit on each one, until you have all of the distributions you want packed up
in this fashion. Each distribution should go into a subdirectory on the floppy, e.g.: <tt
class="FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.aa</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">a:\bin\bin.ab</tt>, and so
on.</p>

<p>Once you come to the Media screen during the install process, select <span

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALL-MSDOS" name="INSTALL-MSDOS">2.13.4 Installing from an
<span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg; Partition</a></h2>

<p>To prepare for an installation from an <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>
partition, copy the files from the distribution into a directory called <tt
class="FILENAME">freebsd</tt> in the root directory of the partition. For example, <tt
class="FILENAME">c:\freebsd</tt>. The directory structure of the CDROM or FTP site must
be partially reproduced within this directory, so we suggest using the DOS <tt
class="COMMAND">xcopy</tt> command if you are copying it from a CD. For example, to
prepare for a minimal installation of FreeBSD:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">C:\&gt;</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">md c:\freebsd</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">C:\&gt;</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">xcopy e:\bin c:\freebsd\bin\ /s</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">C:\&gt;</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">xcopy e:\manpages c:\freebsd\manpages\ /s</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Assuming that <tt class="DEVICENAME">C:</tt> is where you have free space and <tt
class="DEVICENAME">E:</tt> is where your CDROM is mounted.</p>

<p>If you do not have a CDROM drive, you can download the distribution from <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/6.0-RELEASE/"
target="_top">ftp.FreeBSD.org</a>. Each distribution is in its own directory; for
example, the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">base</i></span> distribution can
be found in the <a
href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/6.0-RELEASE/base/"
target="_top">6.0/base/</a> directory.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> In the 4.X and older releases of FreeBSD the “base” distribution is
called “bin”. Adjust the sample commands and URLs above accordingly, if you are using
one of these versions.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>For as many distributions you wish to install from an <span
class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> partition (and you have the free space for), install each
one under <tt class="FILENAME">c:\freebsd</tt> -- the <tt class="LITERAL">BIN</tt>
distribution is the only one required for a minimum installation.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN3549" name="AEN3549">2.13.5 Creating an Installation
Tape</a></h2>

<p>Installing from tape is probably the easiest method, short of an online FTP install or
CDROM install. The installation program expects the files to be simply tarred onto the
tape. After getting all of the distribution files you are interested in, simply tar them
onto the tape:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">cd /freebsd/distdir</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">tar cvf /dev/rwt0 dist1 ... dist2</kbd>
</pre>

<p>When you perform the installation, you should make sure that you leave enough room in
some temporary directory (which you will be allowed to choose) to accommodate the <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">full</i></span> contents of the tape you have
created. Due to the non-random access nature of tapes, this method of installation
requires quite a bit of temporary storage.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> When starting the installation, the tape must be in the drive <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">before</i></span> booting from the boot floppy. The
installation probe may otherwise fail to find it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN3565" name="AEN3565">2.13.6 Before Installing over a
Network</a></h2>

<p>There are three types of network installations available. Serial port (SLIP or PPP),
Parallel port (PLIP (laplink cable)), or Ethernet (a standard Ethernet controller
(includes some PCMCIA)).</p>

<p>The SLIP support is rather primitive, and limited primarily to hard-wired links, such
as a serial cable running between a laptop computer and another computer. The link should
be hard-wired as the SLIP installation does not currently offer a dialing capability;
that facility is provided with the PPP utility, which should be used in preference to
SLIP whenever possible.</p>

<p>If you are using a modem, then PPP is almost certainly your only choice. Make sure
that you have your service provider's information handy as you will need to know it
fairly early in the installation process.</p>

<p>If you use PAP or CHAP to connect your ISP (in other words, if you can connect to the
ISP in <span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span> without using a script), then all you will
need to do is type in <tt class="COMMAND">dial</tt> at the <b class="APPLICATION">ppp</b>
prompt. Otherwise, you will need to know how to dial your ISP using the “AT commands”
specific to your modem, as the PPP dialer provides only a very simple terminal emulator.
Please refer to the user-ppp <a href="userppp.html">handbook</a> and <a
href="../../../../doc/zh_TW.Big5/books/faq/ppp.html" target="_top">FAQ</a> entries for
further information. If you have problems, logging can be directed to the screen using
the command <tt class="COMMAND">set log local ...</tt>.</p>

<p>If a hard-wired connection to another FreeBSD (2.0-R or later) machine is available,
you might also consider installing over a “laplink” parallel port cable. The data rate
over the parallel port is much higher than what is typically possible over a serial line
(up to 50&nbsp;kbytes/sec), thus resulting in a quicker installation.</p>

<p>Finally, for the fastest possible network installation, an Ethernet adapter is always
a good choice! FreeBSD supports most common PC Ethernet cards; a table of supported cards
(and their required settings) is provided in the Hardware Notes for each release of
FreeBSD. If you are using one of the supported PCMCIA Ethernet cards, also be sure that
it is plugged in <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">before</i></span> the laptop
is powered on! FreeBSD does not, unfortunately, currently support hot insertion of PCMCIA
cards during installation.</p>

<p>You will also need to know your IP address on the network, the netmask value for your
address class, and the name of your machine. If you are installing over a PPP connection
and do not have a static IP, fear not, the IP address can be dynamically assigned by your
ISP. Your system administrator can tell you which values to use for your particular
network setup. If you will be referring to other hosts by name rather than IP address,
you will also need a name server and possibly the address of a gateway (if you are using
PPP, it is your provider's IP address) to use in talking to it. If you want to install by
FTP via a HTTP proxy, you will also need the proxy's address. If you do not know the
answers to all or most of these questions, then you should really probably talk to your
system administrator or ISP <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">before</i></span>
trying this type of installation.</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN3596" name="AEN3596">2.13.6.1 Before Installing via
NFS</a></h3>

<p>The NFS installation is fairly straight-forward. Simply copy the FreeBSD distribution
files you want onto an NFS server and then point the NFS media selection at it.</p>

<p>If this server supports only “privileged port” (as is generally the default for Sun
workstations), you will need to set the option <tt class="LITERAL">NFS Secure</tt> in the
<span class="GUIMENU">Options</span> menu before installation can proceed.</p>

<p>If you have a poor quality Ethernet card which suffers from very slow transfer rates,
you may also wish to toggle the <tt class="LITERAL">NFS Slow</tt> flag.</p>

<p>In order for NFS installation to work, the server must support subdir mounts, for
example, if your FreeBSD&nbsp;6.0 distribution directory lives on: <tt
class="FILENAME">ziggy:/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>, then <tt
class="HOSTID">ziggy</tt> will have to allow the direct mounting of <tt
class="FILENAME">/usr/archive/stuff/FreeBSD</tt>, not just <tt class="FILENAME">/usr</tt>
or <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/archive/stuff</tt>.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD's <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/exports</tt> file, this is controlled by the
<code class="OPTION">-alldirs</code> options. Other NFS servers may have different
conventions. If you are getting “<tt class="ERRORNAME">permission denied</tt>” messages
from the server, then it is likely that you do not have this enabled properly.</p>
