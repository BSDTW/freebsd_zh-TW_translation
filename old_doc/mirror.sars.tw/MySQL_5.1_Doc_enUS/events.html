      MySQL Events are tasks that run according to a schedule.
      Therefore, we sometimes refer to them as
      <span class="emphasis"><em>scheduled</em></span> events. When you create an event,
      you are creating a named database object containing one or more
      SQL statements to be executed at one or more regular intervals,
      beginning and ending at a specific date and time. Conceptually,
      this is similar to the idea of the Unix <code class="literal">crontab</code>
      (also known as a “<span class="quote">cron job</span>”) or the Windows Task
      Scheduler.
    </p><p>
      Scheduled tasks of this type are also sometimes known as
      “<span class="quote">temporal triggers</span>”, implying that these are objects
      that are triggered by the passage of time. While this is
      essentially correct, we prefer to use the term
      <span class="emphasis"><em>events</em></span> in order to avoid confusion with
      triggers of the type discussed in <a href="triggers.html" title="Chapter 24. Triggers">Chapter 24, <i>Triggers</i></a>.
      Events should more specifically not be confused with
      “<span class="quote">temporary triggers</span>”. Whereas a trigger is a database
      object whose statements are executed in response to a specific
      type of event that occurs on a given table, a (scheduled) event is
      an object whose statements are executed in response to the passage
      of a specified time interval.
    </p><p>
      While there is no provision in the SQL Standard for event
      scheduling, there are precedents in other database systems, and
      you may notice some similarities between these implementations and
      that found in the MySQL Server.
    </p><p>
      MySQL Events have the following major features and properties:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          In MySQL 5.1.12 and later, an event is uniquely identified by
          its name and the schema to which it is assigned. (Previously,
          an event was also unique to its definer.)
        </p></li><li><p>
          An event performs a specific action according to a schedule.
          This action consists of an SQL statement, which can be a
          compound statement in a <code class="literal">BEGIN ... END</code> block
          if desired (see <a href="stored-procedures.html#begin-end" title="23.2.7. BEGIN ... END Compound Statement Syntax">Section 23.2.7, “<code class="literal">BEGIN ... END</code> Compound Statement Syntax”</a>). An event's
          timing can be either <em class="firstterm">one-time</em> or
          <em class="firstterm">recurrent</em>. A one-time event executes
          one time only. A recurrent event repeats its action at a
          regular interval, and the schedule for a recurring event can
          be assigned a specific start day and time, end day and time,
          both, or neither. (By default, a recurring event's schedule
          begins as soon as it is created, and continues indefinitely,
          until it is disabled or dropped.)
        </p></li><li><p>
          Users can create, modify, and drop scheduled events using SQL
          statements intended for these purposes. Syntactically invalid
          event creation and modification statements fail with an
          appropriate error message. <span class="emphasis"><em>A user may include
          statements in an event's action which require privileges that
          the user does not actually have</em></span>. The event creation
          or modification statement succeeds but the event's action
          fails. See <a href="events.html#events-privileges" title="25.5. The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges">Section 25.5, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”</a> for details.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Many of the properties of an event can be set or modified
          using SQL statements. These properties include the event's
          name, timing, persistence (that is, whether it is preserved
          following the expiration of its schedule), status (enabled or
          disabled), action to be performed, and the schema to which it
          is assigned. See <a href="events.html#alter-event" title="25.2.1. ALTER EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.1, “<code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>.
        </p><p>
          The default definer of an event is the user who created the
          event, unless the event has been altered, in which case the
          definer is the user who issued the last <code class="literal">ALTER
          EVENT</code> statement affecting that event. An event can
          be modified by any user having the <code class="literal">EVENT</code>
          privilege on the database for which the event is defined.
          (Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, only an event's definer, or a user
          having privileges on the <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> table,
          could modify a given event.) See
          <a href="events.html#events-privileges" title="25.5. The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges">Section 25.5, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          An event's action statement may include most SQL statements
          permitted within stored routines.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Events are executed by a special <em class="firstterm">event scheduler
      thread</em>; when we refer to the Event Scheduler, we
      actually refer to this thread. When running, the event scheduler
      thread and its current state can be seen by users having the
      <code class="literal">PROCESS</code> privilege in the output of
      <code class="literal">SHOW PROCESSLIST</code>, as shown in the discussion
      that follows.
    </p><a class="indexterm" name="id2438127"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2438139"></a><p><a name="events-event-scheduler-option"></a>
      The global <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> system variable
      determines whether the Event Scheduler is enabled and running on
      the server. Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, it has one of these 3
      values, which affect event scheduling as described here:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="literal">OFF</code>: The Event Scheduler is stopped. The
          event scheduler thread does not run, is not shown in the
          output of <code class="literal">SHOW PROCESSLIST</code>, and no
          scheduled events are executed. <code class="literal">OFF</code> is the
          default value for <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code>.
        </p><p>
          When the Event Scheduler is stopped
          (<code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> is
          <code class="literal">OFF</code>), it can be started by setting the
          value of <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> to
          <code class="literal">ON</code>. (See next item.)
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">ON</code>: The Event Scheduler is started; the
          event scheduler thread runs and executes all scheduled events.
        </p><a class="indexterm" name="id2438238"></a><p>
          When the Event Scheduler is <code class="literal">ON</code>, the event
          scheduler thread is listed in the output of <code class="literal">SHOW
          PROCESSLIST</code> as a daemon process, and its state is
          represented as shown here:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SHOW PROCESSLIST\G</code></strong>
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 1
   User: root
   Host: localhost
     db: NULL
Command: Query
   Time: 0
  State: NULL
   Info: show processlist
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     Id: 2
   User: event_scheduler
   Host: localhost
     db: NULL
Command: Daemon
   Time: 3
  State: Waiting for next activation
   Info: NULL
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre><p>
          Event scheduling can be stopped by setting the value of
          <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> to <code class="literal">OFF</code>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>: This value renders the Event
          Scheduler non-operational. When the Event Scheduler is
          <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>, the event scheduler thread does
          not run (and so does not appear in the output of <code class="literal">SHOW
          PROCESSLIST</code>). In addition, the Event Scheduler state
          cannot be changed at runtime.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      If the Event Scheduler status has not been set to
      <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>, <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code>
      can be toggled between <code class="literal">ON</code> and
      <code class="literal">OFF</code> (using <code class="literal">SET</code>). It is also
      possible to use <code class="literal">0</code> for <code class="literal">OFF</code>,
      and <code class="literal">1</code> for <code class="literal">ON</code> when setting
      this variable. Thus, any of the following 4 statements can be used
      in the <span><strong class="command">mysql</strong></span> client to turn on the Event
      Scheduler:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
SET @@global.event_scheduler = ON;
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 1;
SET @@global.event_scheduler = 1;
</pre><p>
      Similarly, any of these 4 statements can be used to turn off the
      Event Scheduler:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = OFF;
SET @@global.event_scheduler = OFF;
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 0;
SET @@global.event_scheduler = 0;
</pre><p>
      Although <code class="literal">ON</code> and <code class="literal">OFF</code> have
      numeric equivalents, the value displayed for
      <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> by <code class="literal">SELECT</code> or
      <code class="literal">SHOW VARIABLES</code> is always one of
      <code class="literal">OFF</code>, <code class="literal">ON</code>, or
      <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>. <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">DISABLED</code>
      has no numeric equivalent</em></span>. For this reason,
      <code class="literal">ON</code> and <code class="literal">OFF</code> are usually
      preferred over <code class="literal">1</code> and <code class="literal">0</code> when
      setting this variable.
    </p><p>
      Note that attempting to set <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code>
      without specifying it as a global variable causes an error:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&lt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET @@event_scheduler = OFF;</code></strong>
<span class="errortext">ERROR 1229 (HY000): Variable 'event_scheduler' is a GLOBAL
variable and should be set with SET GLOBAL</span>
</pre><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
        It is possible to set the Event Scheduler to
        <code class="literal">DISABLED</code> only at server startup. If
        <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> is <code class="literal">ON</code> or
        <code class="literal">OFF</code>, you cannot set it to
        <code class="literal">DISABLED</code> at runtime. Also, if the Event
        Scheduler is set to <code class="literal">DISABLED</code> at startup, you
        cannot change the value of <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> at
        runtime.
      </p></div><p>
      To disable the event scheduler, use one of the following two
      methods:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          As a command-line option when starting the server:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">--event-scheduler=DISABLED
</pre></li><li><p>
          In the server configuration file (<code class="filename">my.cnf</code>,
          or <code class="filename">my.ini</code> on Windows systems), include
          the line where it will be read by the server (for example, in
          a <code class="literal">[mysqld]</code> section):
        </p><pre class="programlisting">event_scheduler=DISABLED
</pre></li></ul></div><p>
      To enable the Event Scheduler, restart the server without the
      <code class="option">--event-scheduler=DISABLED</code> command-line option,
      or after removing or commenting out the line containing
      <code class="literal">event_scheduler=DISABLED</code> in the server
      configuration file, as appropriate. Alternatively, you can use
      <code class="literal">ON</code> (or <code class="literal">1</code>) or
      <code class="literal">OFF</code> (or <code class="literal">0</code>) in place of the
      <code class="literal">DISABLED</code> value when starting the server.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        You can issue event-manipulation statements when
        <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> is set to
        <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>. No warnings or errors are generated
        in such cases (provided that the statements are themselves
        valid). However, scheduled events cannot execute until this
        variable is set to <code class="literal">ON</code> (or
        <code class="literal">1</code>). Once this has been done, the event
        scheduler thread executes all events whose scheduling conditions
        are satisfied.
      </p></div><p>
      In MySQL 5.1.11, <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> behaved as
      follows: this variable could take one of the values
      <code class="literal">0</code> (or <code class="literal">OFF</code>),
      <code class="literal">1</code> (or <code class="literal">ON</code>), or
      <code class="literal">2</code>. Setting it to <code class="literal">0</code> turned
      event scheduling off, so that the event scheduler thread did not
      run; the <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> variable could not be
      set to this value while the server was running. Setting it to
      <code class="literal">1</code> so that the event scheduler thread ran and
      executed scheduled events. In this state, the event scheduler
      thread appeared to be sleeping when viewed with <code class="literal">SHOW
      PROCESSLIST</code>. When <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> was
      set to <code class="literal">2</code> (which was the default value), the
      Event Scheduler was considered to be “<span class="quote">suspended</span>”; the
      event scheduler thread ran and could be seen in the output of
      <code class="literal">SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> (where
      <code class="literal">Suspended</code> was displayed in the
      <code class="literal">State</code> column), but did not execute any
      scheduled events. The value of <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code>
      could be changed only between <code class="literal">1</code> (or
      <code class="literal">ON</code>) and <code class="literal">2</code> while the server
      was running. Setting it to <code class="literal">0</code> (or
      <code class="literal">OFF</code>) required a server restart, as did changing
      its value from <code class="literal">0</code> (or <code class="literal">OFF</code>) to
      <code class="literal">1</code> (or <code class="literal">ON</code>) or
      <code class="literal">2</code>.
    </p><p>
      Prior to MySQL 5.1.11, <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> could
      take one of only the 2 values
      <code class="literal">0</code>|<code class="literal">OFF</code> or
      <code class="literal">1</code>|<code class="literal">ON</code>, and the default value
      was <code class="literal">0</code>|<code class="literal">OFF</code>. It was also
      possible to start and stop the event scheduler thread while the
      MySQL server was running.
    </p><p>
      For more information concerning the reasons for these changes in
      behaviour, see <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/17619" target="_top">Bug#17619</a>.
    </p><p>
      Beginning with MySQL 5.1.17, starting the MySQL server with the
      <code class="option">--skip-grant-tables</code> option causes
      <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> to be set to
      <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>, overriding any other value set either
      on the command line or in the <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> or
      <code class="filename">my.ini</code> file (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/26807" target="_top">Bug#26807</a>).
    </p><p>
      For SQL statements used to create, alter, and drop events, see
      <a href="events.html#events-syntax" title="25.2. Event Scheduler Syntax">Section 25.2, “Event Scheduler Syntax”</a>.
    </p><p>
      MySQL 5.1.6 and later provides an <code class="literal">EVENTS</code> table
      in the <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code> database. This table
      can be queried to obtain information about scheduled events which
      have been defined on the server. See
      <a href="events.html#events-metadata" title="25.3. Event Metadata">Section 25.3, “Event Metadata”</a>, and
      <a href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="27.20. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table">Section 27.20, “The <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS</code> Table”</a>, for more information.

      system, see <a href="events.html#events-privileges" title="25.5. The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges">Section 25.5, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”</a>.

      MySQL 5.1.6 and later provides several SQL statements for working
      with scheduled events:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          New events are defined using the <code class="literal">CREATE
          EVENT</code> statement. See <a href="events.html#create-event" title="25.2.2. CREATE EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.2, “<code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          The definition of an existing event can be changed by means of
          the <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement. See
          <a href="events.html#alter-event" title="25.2.1. ALTER EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.1, “<code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          When a scheduled event is no longer wanted or needed, it can
          be deleted from the server by its definer using the
          <code class="literal">DROP EVENT</code> statement. See
          <a href="events.html#drop-event" title="25.2.3. DROP EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.3, “<code class="literal">DROP EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>. (Whether an event persists past
          the end of its schedule also depends on its <code class="literal">ON
          COMPLETION</code> clause, if it has one. See
          <a href="events.html#create-event" title="25.2.2. CREATE EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.2, “<code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>.)
        </p><p>
          An event can be deleted by any user having the
          <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege for the database on which
          the event is defined. Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, a user other than
          the definer required privileges on the
          <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> table. See
          <a href="events.html#events-privileges" title="25.5. The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges">Section 25.5, “The Event Scheduler and MySQL Privileges”</a>.

        The <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement is used to change
        one or more of the characteristics of an existing event without
        the need to drop and recreate it. The syntax for each of the
        <code class="literal">DEFINER</code>, <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code>,
        <code class="literal">ON COMPLETION</code>, <code class="literal">COMMENT</code>,
        <code class="literal">ENABLE</code> / <code class="literal">DISABLE</code>, and
        <code class="literal">DO</code> clauses is exactly the same as when used
        with <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code>. (See
        <a href="events.html#create-event" title="25.2.2. CREATE EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.2, “<code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>.)
      </p><p>
        Support for the <code class="literal">DEFINER</code> clause was added in
        MySQL 5.1.17.
      </p><p>
        Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, any user can alter an event defined
        on a database for which that user has the
        <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege. When a user executes a
        successful <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement, that user
        becomes the definer for the affected event.
      </p><p>
        (In MySQL 5.1.11 and earlier, an event could be altered only by
        its definer, or by a user having the <code class="literal">SUPER</code>
        privilege.)
      </p><p>
        <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> works only with an existing
        event:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>ALTER EVENT no_such_event </code></strong>
     &gt;     <strong class="userinput"><code>ON SCHEDULE </code></strong>
     &gt;       <strong class="userinput"><code>EVERY '2:3' DAY_HOUR;</code></strong>
<span class="errortext">ERROR 1517 (HY000): Unknown event 'no_such_event'</span>
</pre><p>
        In each of the following examples, assume that the event named
        <code class="literal">myevent</code> is defined as shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 6 HOUR
    COMMENT 'A sample comment.'
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
</pre><p>
        The following statement changes the schedule for
        <code class="literal">myevent</code> from once every six hours starting
        immediately to once every twelve hours, starting four hours from
        the time the statement is run:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 12 HOUR 
    STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + 4 HOUR;
</pre><p>
        It is possible to change multiple characteristics of an event in
        a single statement. This example changes the SQL statement
        executed by <code class="literal">myevent</code> to one that deletes all
        records from <code class="literal">mytable</code>; it also changes the
        schedule for the event such that it executes once, one day after
        this <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement is run.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER TABLE myevent
    ON SCHEDULE 
      AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 DAY
    DO
      TRUNCATE TABLE myschema.mytable;
</pre><p>
        It is necessary to include only those options in an
        <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement which correspond to
        characteristics that you actually wish to change; options which
        are omitted retain their existing values. This includes any
        default values for <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> such as
        <code class="literal">ENABLE</code>.
      </p><p>
        To disable <code class="literal">myevent</code>, use this <code class="literal">ALTER
        EVENT</code> statement:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER EVENT myevent
    DISABLE;
</pre><p>
        The <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clause may use expressions
        involving built-in MySQL functions and user variables to obtain
        any of the <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em> or
        <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em> values which it contains.
        You may not use stored routines or user-defined functions in
        such expressions, nor may you use any table references; however,
        you may use <code class="literal">SELECT FROM DUAL</code>. This is true
        for both <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> and <code class="literal">CREATE
        EVENT</code> statements. Beginning with MySQL 5.1.13,
        references to stored routines, user-defined functions, and
        tables in such cases are specifically disallowed, and fail with
        an error (see <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/22830" target="_top">Bug#22830</a>).
      </p><p>
        An <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement that contains
        another <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement in its
        <code class="literal">DO</code> clause appears to succeed; however, when
        the server attempts to execute the resulting scheduled event,
        the execution fails with an error.
      </p><p>
        To rename an event, use the <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code>
        statement's <code class="literal">RENAME TO</code> clause. This statement
        renames the event <code class="literal">myevent</code> to
        <code class="literal">yourevent</code>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER EVENT myevent
    RENAME TO yourevent;
</pre><p>
        You can also move an event to a different database using
        <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT ... RENAME TO ...</code> and
        <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>db_name.event_name</code></em></code>
        notation, as shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">ALTER EVENT olddb.myevent
    RENAME TO newdb.myevent;
</pre><p>
        To execute the previous statement, the user executing it must
        have the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege on both the
        <code class="literal">olddb</code> and <code class="literal">newdb</code> databases.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          There is no <code class="literal">RENAME EVENT</code> statement.
        </p></div><p>
        Beginning with MySQL 5.1.18, a third value may also appear in
        place of <code class="literal">ENABLED</code> or
        <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>; <code class="literal">DISABLE ON SLAVE</code>
        is used on a replication slave to indicate an event which was
        created on the master and replicated to the slave, but which is
        not executed on the slave. Normally, <code class="literal">DISABLE ON
        SLAVE</code> is set automatically as required; however, there
        are some circumstances under which you may want or need to
        change it manually. See
        <a href="replication.html#replication-features-invoked" title="19.3.1.5. Replication of Invoked Features">Section 19.3.1.5, “Replication of Invoked Features”</a>, for more

        This statement creates and schedules a new event. The minimum
        requirements for a valid <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code>
        statement are as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            The keywords <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> plus an event
            name, which uniquely identifies the event in the current
            schema. (Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, the event name needed to be
            unique only among events created by the same user on a given
            database.)
          </p></li><li><p>
            An <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clause, which determines
            when and how often the event executes.
          </p></li><li><p>
            A <code class="literal">DO</code> clause, which contains the SQL
            statement to be executed by an event.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        This is an example of a minimal <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code>
        statement:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
</pre><p>
        The previous statement creates an event named
        <code class="literal">myevent</code>. This event executes once — one
        hour following its creation — by running an SQL statement
        that increments the value of the
        <code class="literal">myschema.mytable</code> table's
        <code class="literal">mycol</code> column by 1.
      </p><p>
        The <em class="replaceable"><code>event_name</code></em> must be a valid MySQL
        identifier with a maximum length of 64 characters. It may be
        delimited using back ticks, and may be qualified with the name
        of a database schema. An event is associated with both a MySQL
        user (the definer) and a schema, and its name must be unique
        among names of events within that schema. In general, the rules
        governing event names are the same as those for names of stored
        routines. See <a href="language-structure.html#identifiers" title="8.2. Schema Object Names">Section 8.2, “Schema Object Names”</a>.
      </p><p>
        If no schema is indicated as part of
        <em class="replaceable"><code>event_name</code></em>, the default (current)
        schema is assumed.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          MySQL uses case-insensitive comparisons when checking for the
          uniqueness of event names. This means that, for example, you
          cannot have two events named <code class="literal">myevent</code> and
          <code class="literal">MyEvent</code> in the same database schema.
        </p></div><p>
        The <code class="literal">DEFINER</code> clause specifies the MySQL
        account to be used when checking access privileges at event
        execution time. If a <em class="replaceable"><code>user</code></em> value is
        given, it should be a MySQL account in
        <code class="literal">'<em class="replaceable"><code>user_name</code></em>'@'<em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>'</code>
        format (the same format used in the <code class="literal">GRANT</code>
        statement). The <em class="replaceable"><code>user_name</code></em> and
        <em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em> values both are required.
        The definer can also be given as
        <a href="functions.html#function_current-user"><code class="literal">CURRENT_USER</code></a> or
        <a href="functions.html#function_current-user"><code class="literal">CURRENT_USER()</code></a>. The default
        <code class="literal">DEFINER</code> value is the user who executes the
        <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> statement. (This is the same as
        <code class="literal">DEFINER = CURRENT_USER</code>.)
      </p><p>
        The <code class="literal">DEFINER</code> clause was added in MySQL 5.1.17.
        (Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, it was possible for two different users
        to create different events having the same name on the same
        database schema.)
      </p><p>
        <code class="literal">IF NOT EXISTS</code> has the same meaning for
        <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> as for <code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE</code>: If an event named
        <em class="replaceable"><code>event_name</code></em> already exists in the same
        schema, no action is taken, and no error results. (However, a
        warning is generated in such cases.)
      </p><p>
        The <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clause determines when, how
        often, and for how long the
        <em class="replaceable"><code>sql_statement</code></em> defined for the event
        repeats. This clause takes one of two forms:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <code class="literal">AT <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em></code>
            is used for a one-time event. It specifies that the event
            executes one time only at the date and time given by
            <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em>, which must include
            both the date and time, or must be an expression that
            resolves to a datetime value. You may use a value of either
            the <code class="literal">DATETIME</code> or
            <code class="literal">TIMESTAMP</code> type for this purpose. If the
            date is in the past, a warning occurs, as shown here:

            <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> statements which are

            with an error.
          </p><p>
            You may use
            <a href="functions.html#function_current-timestamp"><code class="literal">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code></a> to specify
            the current date and time. In such a case, the event acts as
            soon as it is created.
          </p><p>
            To create an event which occurs at some point in the future
            relative to the current date and time — such as that
            expressed by the phrase “<span class="quote">three weeks from now</span>”
            — you can use the optional clause <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL
            <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em></code>. The
            <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em> portion consists of two
            parts, a quantity and a unit of time, and follows the same
            syntax rules that govern intervals used in the
            <a href="functions.html#function_date-add"><code class="literal">DATE_ADD()</code></a> function (see
            <a href="functions.html#date-and-time-functions" title="11.6. Date and Time Functions">Section 11.6, “Date and Time Functions”</a>. The units
            keywords are also the same, except that you cannot use any
            units involving microseconds when defining an event. With
            some interval types, complex time units may be used. For
            example, “<span class="quote">two minutes and ten seconds</span>” can be
            expressed as <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL '2:10'
            MINUTE_SECOND</code>.
          </p><p>
            You can also combine intervals. For example, <code class="literal">AT
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 3 WEEK + INTERVAL 2
            DAY</code> is equivalent to “<span class="quote">three weeks and two
            days from now</span>”. Each portion of such a clause must
            begin with <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL</code>.
          </p></li><li><p>
            To repeat actions at a regular interval, use an
            <code class="literal">EVERY</code> clause. The
            <code class="literal">EVERY</code> keyword is followed by an
            <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em> as described in the
            previous dicussion of the <code class="literal">AT</code> keyword.
            (<code class="literal">+ INTERVAL</code> is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            used with <code class="literal">EVERY</code>.) For example,
            <code class="literal">EVERY 6 WEEK</code> means “<span class="quote">every six
            weeks</span>”.
          </p><p>
            Although <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL</code> clauses are not
            allowed in an <code class="literal">EVERY</code> clause, you can use
            the same complex time units allowed in a <code class="literal">+
            INTERVAL</code>.
          </p><p>
            An <code class="literal">EVERY</code> clause may also contain an
            optional <code class="literal">STARTS</code> clause.
            <code class="literal">STARTS</code> is followed by a
            <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em> value which indicates
            when the action should begin repeating, and may also use
            <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL
            <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em></code> in order to
            specify an amount of time “<span class="quote">from now</span>”. For
            example, <code class="literal">EVERY 3 MONTH STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + 1
            WEEK</code> means “<span class="quote">every three months, beginning
            one week from now</span>”. Similarly, you can express
            “<span class="quote">every two weeks, beginning six hours and fifteen
            minutes from now</span>” as <code class="literal">EVERY 2 WEEK STARTS
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '6:15' HOUR_MINUTE</code>.
            Not specifying <code class="literal">STARTS</code> is the same as
            using <code class="literal">STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code> —
            that is, the action specified for the event begins repeating
            immediately upon creation of the event.
          </p><p>
            An <code class="literal">EVERY</code> clause may also contain an
            optional <code class="literal">ENDS</code> clause. The
            <code class="literal">ENDS</code> keyword is followed by a
            <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em> value which tells MySQL
            when the event should stop repeating. You may also use
            <code class="literal">+ INTERVAL
            <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em></code> with
            <code class="literal">ENDS</code>; for instance, <code class="literal">EVERY 12
            HOUR STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 30 MINUTE ENDS
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 4 WEEK</code> is equivalent
            to “<span class="quote">every twelve hours, beginning thirty minutes from
            now, and ending four weeks from now</span>”. Not using
            <code class="literal">ENDS</code> means that the event continues

          </p><p>
            <code class="literal">ENDS</code> supports the same syntax for complex
            time units as <code class="literal">STARTS</code> does.
          </p><p>
            You may use <code class="literal">STARTS</code>,
            <code class="literal">ENDS</code>, both, or neither in an
            <code class="literal">EVERY</code> clause.
          </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
              Beginning with MySQL 5.1.17, <code class="literal">STARTS</code> or
              <code class="literal">ENDS</code> uses the MySQL server's local time
              zone, as shown in the
              <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code> and
              <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> tables, as well as in the
              output of <code class="literal">SHOW EVENTS</code>. Previously, this
              information was stored using UTC (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16420" target="_top">Bug#16420</a>).
            </p><p>
              Due to this change, the <code class="literal">mysql.event</code>
              table must be updated before events created in earlier
              releases can be created, altered, viewed, or used in MySQL
              5.1.17 or later. You can use
              <span><strong class="command">mysql_upgrade</strong></span> for this (see
              <a href="programs.html#mysql-upgrade" title="4.4.8. mysql_upgrade — Check Tables for MySQL Upgrade">Section 4.4.8, “<span><strong class="command">mysql_upgrade</strong></span> — Check Tables for MySQL Upgrade”</a>).
            </p><p>
              See <a href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="27.20. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table">Section 27.20, “The <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS</code> Table”</a>, and
              <a href="sql-syntax.html#show-events" title="12.5.5.18. SHOW EVENTS">Section 12.5.5.18, “<code class="literal">SHOW EVENTS</code>”</a> for information about
              columns added in MySQL 5.1.17 to accomodate these changes.
            </p></div></li></ul></div><p>
        Beginning with MySQL 5.1.18, a third value may also appear in
        place of <code class="literal">ENABLED</code> or
        <code class="literal">DISABLED</code>; <code class="literal">DISABLE ON SLAVE</code>
        is set for the status of an event on a replication slave to
        indicate that the event was created on the master and replicated
        to the slave, but is not executed on the slave. See
        <a href="replication.html#replication-features-invoked" title="19.3.1.5. Replication of Invoked Features">Section 19.3.1.5, “Replication of Invoked Features”</a>.
      </p><p>
        The <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clause may use expressions
        involving built-in MySQL functions and user variables to obtain
        any of the <em class="replaceable"><code>timestamp</code></em> or
        <em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em> values which it contains.
        You may not use stored functions or user-defined functions in
        such expressions, nor may you use any table references; however,
        you may use <code class="literal">SELECT FROM DUAL</code>. This is true
        for both <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> and <code class="literal">ALTER
        EVENT</code> statements. Beginning with MySQL 5.1.13,
        references to stored functions, user-defined functions, and
        tables in such cases are specifically disallowed, and fail with
        an error (see <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/22830" target="_top">Bug#22830</a>).
      </p><p>
        Normally, once an event has expired, it is immediately dropped.
        You can override this behavior by specifying <code class="literal">ON
        COMPLETION PRESERVE</code>. Using <code class="literal">ON COMPLETION NOT
        PRESERVE</code> merely makes the default non-persistent
        behavior explicit.
      </p><p>
        You can create an event but keep it from being active using the
        <code class="literal">DISABLE</code> keyword. Alternatively, you may use
        <code class="literal">ENABLE</code> to make explicit the default status,
        which is active. This is most useful in conjunction with
        <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> (see
        <a href="events.html#alter-event" title="25.2.1. ALTER EVENT Syntax">Section 25.2.1, “<code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> Syntax”</a>).
      </p><p>
        You may supply a comment for an event using a
        <code class="literal">COMMENT</code> clause.
        <em class="replaceable"><code>comment</code></em> may be any string of up to 64
        characters that you wish to use for describing the event. The
        comment text, being a string literal, must be surrounded by
        quotation marks.
      </p><p>
        The <code class="literal">DO</code> clause specifies an action carried by
        the event, and consists of an SQL statement. Nearly any valid
        MySQL statement which can be used in a stored routine can also
        be used as the action statement for a scheduled event. (See
        <a href="restrictions.html#routine-restrictions" title="D.1. Restrictions on Stored Routines, Triggers, and Events">Section D.1, “Restrictions on Stored Routines, Triggers, and Events”</a>.) For example, the
        following event <code class="literal">e_hourly</code> deletes all rows
        from the <code class="literal">sessions</code> table once per hour, where
        this table is part of the <code class="literal">site_activity</code>
        schema:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT e_hourly
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 1 HOUR
    COMMENT 'Clears out sessions table each hour.'
    DO
      DELETE FROM site_activity.sessions;
</pre><p>
        MySQL stores the <code class="literal">sql_mode</code> system variable
        setting that is in effect at the time an event is created, and
        always executes the event with this setting in force,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>regardless of the current server SQL mode</em></span>.
      </p><p>
        A <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> statement that contains an
        <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statement in its
        <code class="literal">DO</code> clause appears to succeed; however, when
        the server attempts to execute the resulting scheduled event,
        the execution fails with an error.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          Statements such as <code class="literal">SELECT</code> or
          <code class="literal">SHOW</code> that merely return a result set have
          no effect when used in an event; the output from these is not
          sent to the MySQL Monitor, nor is it stored anywhere. However,
          you can use statements such as <code class="literal">SELECT ...
          INTO</code> and <code class="literal">INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code>
          that store a result. (See the next example in this section for
          an instance of the latter.)
        </p></div><p>
        The schema to which an event belongs is the default schema for
        table references in the <code class="literal">DO</code> clause. Any
        references to tables in other schemas must be qualified with the
        proper schema name. (In MySQL 5.1.6, all tables referenced in
        event <code class="literal">DO</code> clauses had to include a reference
        to the schema.)
      </p><p>
        As with stored routines, you can use compound-statement syntax
        in the <code class="literal">DO</code> clause by using the
        <code class="literal">BEGIN</code> and <code class="literal">END</code> keywords, as
        shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">DELIMITER |

CREATE EVENT e_daily
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 1 DAY
    COMMENT 'Saves total number of sessions then clears the table each day.'
    DO
      BEGIN
        INSERT INTO site_activity.totals (when, total)
          SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, COUNT(*) 
            FROM site_activity.sessions;
        DELETE FROM site_activity.sessions;
      END |

DELIMITER ;
</pre><p>
        Note the use of the <code class="literal">DELIMITER</code> command to
        change the statement delimiter, as with stored routines. See
        <a href="stored-procedures.html#create-procedure" title="23.2.2. CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE
        FUNCTION Syntax">Section 23.2.2, “<code class="literal">CREATE PROCEDURE</code> and <code class="literal">CREATE
        FUNCTION</code> Syntax”</a>.
      </p><p>
        More complex compound statements, such as those used in stored
        routines, are possible in an event. This example uses local
        variables, an error handler, and a flow control construct:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">DELIMITER |

CREATE EVENT e
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 5 SECOND
    DO
      BEGIN
        DECLARE v INTEGER;
        DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN END;

        SET v = 0;

        WHILE v &lt; 5 DO
          INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (0);
          UPDATE t2 SET s1 = s1 + 1;
          SET v = v + 1;
        END WHILE;
    END |

DELIMITER ;
</pre><p>
        There is no way to pass parameters directly to or from events;
        however, it is possible to invoke a stored routine with
        parameters:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT e_call_myproc
    ON SCHEDULE 
      AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 DAY
    DO CALL myproc(5, 27); 
</pre><p>
        In addition, if the event's definer has the
        <code class="literal">SUPER</code> privilege, that event may read and
        write global variables. As granting this privilege entails a
        potential for abuse, extreme care must be taken in doing so.
      </p><p>
        Generally, any statements which are valid in stored routines may
        be used for action statements executed by events. For more
        information about statements allowable within stored routines,
        see <a href="stored-procedures.html#stored-procedure-syntax" title="23.2. Stored Routine Syntax">Section 23.2, “Stored Routine Syntax”</a>. You can create an
        event as part of a stored routine, but an event cannot be

      To enable or disable the execution of scheduled events, it is
      necessary to set the value of the global
      <code class="literal">event_scheduler</code> system variable. This requires
      the <code class="literal">SUPER</code> privilege.
    </p><p>
      MySQL 5.1.6 introduces a privilege governing the creation,
      modification, and deletion of events, the <code class="literal">EVENT</code>
      privilege. This privilege can be bestowed using
      <code class="literal">GRANT</code>. For example, this
      <code class="literal">GRANT</code> statement confers the
      <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege for the schema named
      <code class="literal">myschema</code> on the user
      <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">GRANT EVENT ON myschema.* TO jon@ghidora;
</pre><p>
      (We assume that this user account already exists, and that we wish
      for it to remain unchanged otherwise.)
    </p><p>
      To grant this same user the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege on
      all schemas, use the following statement:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">GRANT EVENT ON *.* TO jon@ghidora;
</pre><p>
      The <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege has global or schema-level
      scope. Therefore, trying to grant it on a single table results in
      an error as shown:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>GRANT EVENT ON myschema.mytable TO jon@ghidora;</code></strong>
<span class="errortext">ERROR 1144 (42000): Illegal GRANT/REVOKE command; please
consult the manual to see which privileges can be used</span>
</pre><p>
      It is important to understand that an event is executed with the
      privileges of its definer, and that it cannot perform any actions
      for which its definer does not have the requisite privileges. For
      example, suppose that <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code> has the
      <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege for
      <code class="literal">myschema</code>. Suppose also that this user has the
      <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege for
      <code class="literal">myschema</code>, but no other privileges for this
      schema. It is possible for <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code> to
      create a new event such as this one:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT e_store_ts
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 10 SECOND
    DO 
      INSERT INTO myschema.mytable VALUES (UNIX_TIMESTAMP());
</pre><p>
      The user waits for a minute or so, and then performs a
      <code class="literal">SELECT * FROM mytable;</code> query, expecting to see
      several new rows in the table. Instead, he finds that the table is
      empty. Since he does not have the <code class="literal">INSERT</code>
      privilege for the table in question, the event has no effect.
    </p><p>
      If you inspect the MySQL error log
      (<code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>hostname</code></em>.err</code>),
      you can see that the event is executing, but the action it is
      attempting to perform fails, as indicated by
      <code class="literal">RetCode=0</code>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">060209 22:39:44 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTING event newdb.e [EXPR:10]
060209 22:39:44 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTED event newdb.e  [EXPR:10]. RetCode=0
060209 22:39:54 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTING event newdb.e [EXPR:10]
060209 22:39:54 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTED event newdb.e  [EXPR:10]. RetCode=0
060209 22:40:04 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTING event newdb.e [EXPR:10]
060209 22:40:04 [Note]     EVEX EXECUTED event newdb.e  [EXPR:10]. RetCode=0
</pre><p>
      Since this user very likely does not have access to the error log,
      he can verify whether the event's action statement is valid by
      running it himself:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>INSERT INTO myschema.mytable VALUES (UNIX_TIMESTAMP());</code></strong>

        statements to be executed. See <a href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="27.20. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table">Section 27.20, “The <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS</code> Table”</a>,
        for more information.
      </p></div><p>
      To rescind the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege, use the
      <code class="literal">REVOKE</code> statement. In this example, the
      <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege on the schema
      <code class="literal">myschema</code> is removed from the
      <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code> user account:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">REVOKE EVENT ON myschema.* FROM jon@ghidora;
</pre><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
        Revoking the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege from a user does
        not delete or disable any events that may have been created by
        that user.
      </p><p>
        An event is not migrated or dropped as a result of renaming or
        dropping the user who created it.
      </p></div><p>
      For example, suppose that the user <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code>
      has been granted the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> and
      <code class="literal">INSERT</code> privileges on the
      <code class="literal">myschema</code> schema. This user then creates the
      following event:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">CREATE EVENT e_insert
    ON SCHEDULE 
      EVERY 7 SECOND
    DO 
      INSERT INTO myschema.mytable;
</pre><p>
      After this event has been created, <code class="literal">root</code> revokes
      the <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege for
      <code class="literal">jon@ghidora</code>. However,
      <code class="literal">e_insert</code> continues to execute, inserting a new
      row into <code class="literal">mytable</code> each seven seconds. The same
      would be true if <code class="literal">root</code> had issued either of
      these statements:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="literal">DROP USER jon@ghidora;</code>
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">RENAME USER jon@ghidora TO
          someotherguy@ghidora;</code>
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      You can verify that this is true by examining the
      <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> table (discussed later in this
      section) or the <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code> table
      (see <a href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="27.20. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table">Section 27.20, “The <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS</code> Table”</a>) before and after issuing a
      <code class="literal">DROP USER</code> or <code class="literal">RENAME USER</code>
      statement.
    </p><a class="indexterm" name="id2441805"></a><p>
      Event definitions are stored in the <code class="literal">mysql.event</code>
      table, which was added in MySQL 5.1.6. To drop an event created by
      another user account, the MySQL <code class="literal">root</code> user (or
      another user with the necessary privileges) can delete rows from
      this table. For example, to remove the event
      <code class="literal">e_insert</code> shown previously,
      <code class="literal">root</code> can use the following statement:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">DELETE FROM mysql.event
    WHERE db = 'myschema' 
      AND definer = 'jon@ghidora' 
      AND name = 'e_insert';
</pre><p>
      It is very important to match the event name, database schema
      name, and user account when deleting rows from the
      <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> table. This is because the same
      user can create different events of the same name in different
      schemas.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        The namespace for scheduled events changed in MySQL 5.1.12.
        Prior to that MySQL version, different users could create
        different events having the same name in the same database; in
        MySQL 5.1.12 and later, that is no longer the case. When
        upgrading to MySQL 5.1.12 or later from MySQL 5.1.11 or earlier,
        it is extremely important to make sure that no events in the
        same database share the same name, <span class="emphasis"><em>prior to performing
        the upgrade</em></span>.
      </p></div><p>
      Users' <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privileges are stored in the
      <code class="literal">Event_priv</code> columns of the
      <code class="literal">mysql.user</code> and <code class="literal">mysql.db</code>
      tables. In both cases, this column holds one of the values
      '<code class="literal">Y</code>' or '<code class="literal">N</code>'.
      '<code class="literal">N</code>' is the default.
      <code class="literal">mysql.user.Event_priv</code> is set to
      '<code class="literal">Y</code>' for a given user only if that user has the
      global <code class="literal">EVENT</code> privilege (that is, if the
      privilege was bestowed using <code class="literal">GRANT EVENT ON
      *.*</code>). For a schema-level <code class="literal">EVENT</code>
      privilege, <code class="literal">GRANT</code> creates a row in
      <code class="literal">mysql.db</code> and sets that row's
      <code class="literal">Db</code> column to the name of the schema, the
      <code class="literal">User</code> column to the name of the user, and the
      <code class="literal">Event_priv</code> column to '<code class="literal">Y</code>'.
      There should never be any need to manipulate these tables
      directly, since the <code class="literal">GRANT EVENT</code> and
      <code class="literal">REVOKE EVENT</code> statement perform the required
      operations on them.
    </p><a class="indexterm" name="id2442007"></a><p>
      MySQL 5.1.6 introduces five status variables providing counts of
      event-related operations (but <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> of
      statements executed by events — see
      <a href="events.html#events-limitations-restrictions" title="25.6. Event Scheduler Limitations and Restrictions">Section 25.6, “Event Scheduler Limitations and Restrictions”</a>). These are:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="literal">Com_create_event</code>: The number of

        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="literal">Com_alter_event</code>: The number of
          <code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code> statements executed since the

          <code class="literal">Com_drop_event</code>: The number of <code class="literal">DROP

        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      You can view current values for all of these at one time by
      running the statement <code class="literal">SHOW STATUS LIKE
      '%event%';</code>.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="events-limitations-restrictions"></a>25.6. Event Scheduler Limitations and Restrictions</h2></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2442157"></a><p>
      This section lists restrictions and limitations applying to event
      scheduling in MySQL 5.1.
    </p><p><b>Qualification of identifiers. </b>
        In MySQL 5.1.6 only, any table referenced in an event's action
        statement must be fully qualified with the name of the schema in
        which it occurs (that is, as
        <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>schema_name</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>table_name</code></em></code>).
      </p><p><b>Case sensitivity of event identifiers. </b>
        Beginning with MySQL 5.1.8, event names are handled in
        case-insensitive fashion. For example, this means that you
        cannot have two events in the same database (and — prior
        to MySQL 5.1.12 — with the same definer) with the names
        <code class="literal">anEvent</code> and <code class="literal">AnEvent</code>.

        </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
            If you have events created in MySQL 5.1.7 or earlier which
            are assigned to the same database and have the same definer,
            and whose names differ only with respect to lettercase, then
            you must rename these events to respect case-sensitive
            handling before upgrading to MySQL 5.1.8 or later.
          </p></div><p>
      </p><p><b>Modification of events by stored routines and triggers. </b>
        An event may not be created, altered, or dropped by a trigger,
        stored routine, or another event. An event also may not create,
        alter, or drop triggers or stored routines. (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16409" target="_top">Bug#16409</a>, <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/18896" target="_top">Bug#18896</a>)
      </p><p><b>Resolution of event timings. </b>
        Event timings using the intervals <code class="literal">YEAR</code>,
        <code class="literal">QUARTER</code>, <code class="literal">MONTH</code>, and
        <code class="literal">YEAR_MONTH</code> are resolved in months; those
        using any other interval are resolved in seconds. There is no
        way to cause events scheduled to occur at the same second to
        execute in a given order. In addition — due to rounding,
        the nature of threaded applications, and the fact that a
        non-zero length of time is required to create events and to
        signal their execution — events may be delayed by as much
        as 1 or 2 seconds. However, the time shown in the
        <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code> table's
        <code class="literal">LAST_EXECUTED</code> column or the
        <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> table's
        <code class="literal">last_executed</code> column is always accurate to
        within one second of the time the event was actually executed.
        (See also <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16522" target="_top">Bug#16522</a>.)
      </p><p><b>Effects on statement counts. </b>
        Each execution of the statements contained in the body of an
        event takes place in a new connection; thus, these statements
        has no effect in a given user session on the server's statement
        counts such as <code class="literal">Com_select</code> and
        <code class="literal">Com_insert</code> that are displayed by
        <code class="literal">SHOW STATUS</code>. However, such counts
        <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> updated in the global scope. (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16422" target="_top">Bug#16422</a>)
      </p><p><b>Visibility of events belonging to other users. </b>
        Prior to MySQL 5.1.12, you could not view another user's events
        in the <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code> table. In
        other words, any query made against this table was treated as
        though it contained the condition <code class="literal">DEFINER =
        CURRENT_USER()</code> in the <code class="literal">WHERE</code> clause.
      </p><p><b>Start times. </b>
        Events cannot be created with a start time that is in the past.
      </p><p><b>Latest time supported. </b>
        Events do not support times later than the end of the Unix
        Epoch; this is approximately the beginning of the year 2038.
        Prior to MySQL 5.1.8, handling in scheduled events of dates
        later than this was buggy; starting with MySQL 5.1.8, such dates
        are specifically disallowed by the Event Scheduler. (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/16396" target="_top">Bug#16396</a>)
      </p><p><b>Server SQL mode. </b>
        In MySQL 5.1.6, <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code>
        shows <code class="literal">NULL</code> in the <code class="literal">SQL_MODE</code>
        column. Beginning with MySQL 5.1.7, the
        <code class="literal">SQL_MODE</code> displayed is that in effect when the
        event was created.
      </p><p><b>Dropping or altering events. </b>
        In MySQL 5.1.6, the only way to drop or alter an event created
        by a user who was not the definer of that event was by
        manipulation of the <code class="literal">mysql.event</code> system table
        by the MySQL <code class="literal">root</code> user or by another user
        with privileges on this table. Beginning with MySQL 5.1.7,
        <code class="literal">DROP USER</code> drops all events for which that
        user was the definer; also beginning with MySQL 5.1.7
        <code class="literal">DROP SCHEMA</code> drops all events associated with
        the dropped schema.
      </p><p><b>Database object references in <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clauses. </b>
        References to stored functions, user-defined functions, and
        tables in the <code class="literal">ON SCHEDULE</code> clauses of
        <code class="literal">CREATE EVENT</code> and <code class="literal">ALTER
        EVENT</code> statements are not supported. Beginning with
        MySQL 5.1.13, these sorts of references are disallowed. (See <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/22830" target="_top">Bug#22830</a> for more information.)
      </p><p><b>Disallowed statements. </b>
        Generally speaking, statements which are not permitted in stored
        routines or in SQL prepared statements are also not allowed in
        the body of an event. See
        <a href="restrictions.html#routine-restrictions" title="D.1. Restrictions on Stored Routines, Triggers, and Events">Section D.1, “Restrictions on Stored Routines, Triggers, and Events”</a>, and
        <a href="sql-syntax.html#sql-syntax-prepared-statements" title="12.7. SQL Syntax for Prepared Statements">Section 12.7, “SQL Syntax for Prepared Statements”</a>, for more
        information.
      </p><p><b>Upgrading to MySQL 5.1.18 or later. </b>
        When upgrading to MySQL 5.1.18 or later from a previous MySQL
        version where scheduled events were in use, the upgrade
        utilities <span><strong class="command">mysql_upgrade</strong></span> and
        <span><strong class="command">mysql_fix_privilege_tables</strong></span> do not accomodate
        changes in system tables relating to the Event Scheduler. As a
        workaround, you can dump events before the upgrade, then restore
        them from the dump afterwards. This issue was fixed in MySQL
        5.1.20 (see <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/28521" target="_top">Bug#28521</a>).
