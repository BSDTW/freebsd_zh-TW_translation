    The MySQL Load Balancer is an application that communicates with one
    or more MySQL servers and provides connectivity to those servers for
    multiple clients. The MySQL Load Balancer is logically placed
    between the clients and the MySQL server; instead of clients
    connecting directly to each MySQL server, all clients connect to the
    MySQL Load Balancer, and the MySQL Load Balancer forwards the
    connection on to one of the MySQL servers.
  </p><p>
    The initial release of the MySQL Load Balancer provides read-only
    load balancing over a number of MySQL servers. Initially, you
    populate the MySQL Load Balancer configuration with the list of
    available MySQL servers to use when distributing work. The MySQL
    Load Balancer automatically and evenly distributes connections from
    clients to each server. Distribution is handled by a simple count
    for the number connections distributed to each server - new
    connections are automatically sent to the server with the lowest
    count.
  </p><p>
    When used in combination with a replication setup, the MySQL Load
    Balancer also monitors the replication status. The master and slaves
    within the replication setup are monitored and additional decisions
    about the routing of incoming connections to MySQL servers are made
    based on the replication status:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        If MySQL Load Balancer identifies that the slave is lagging
        behind the master for it's replication threads, then the slave
        is automatically taken out of the list of available servers.
        Work will therefore be distributed to other MySQL servers within
        the slave replication group.
      </p></li><li><p>
        If the replication thread on a slave is identified as no longer
        running, the slave is also automatically removed from the list
        of available servers.
      </p></li><li><p>
        If either situation changes, such as the replication delay
        decreases to an acceptable level, or the replication thread on
        the failed slave is restarted and the replication process
        catches up, then the slave will be brought back in to the list
        of available MySQL servers.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    The MySQL Load Balancer is based on the MySQL Proxy, and consists of
    two modules which work together to achieve its goal:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
        The <span class="emphasis"><em>proxy</em></span>, which uses Lua scripts to
        customize the handling of connections and query execution. The
        `proxy` connects to several backend MySQL instances to which it
        can send queries.
      </p></li><li><p>
        The <span class="emphasis"><em>monitor</em></span> plugin connects to each of the
        backends the proxy knows about and executes queries on each one
        in regular intervals. The results of those queries are used to
        determine the state of each backend.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>

      MySQL Load Balancer is provided as a TAR/GZipped package. To
      install, extract the package:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">$ gzip -cd load-balancer mysql-load-balancer-0.7.0-438-linux-fc4-x86-32bit.tar.gz | tar xf -</pre><p>
      The standard package contents are organized into four directories:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">/bin
/lib
/sbin
/share
</pre><p>
      The <code class="filename">bin</code> contains wrapper scripts around the
      dynamically linked binaries in <code class="filename">sbin</code>. The
      <code class="filename">lib</code> directory contains the required
      libraries, and the <code class="filename">share</code> directory contains
      the scripts and support files used by the MySQL Load Balancer
      during execution.
    </p><p>
      You can run MySQL Load Balancer directly from this directory, or
      you can copy the contents to a a global directory, such as
      <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">$ cp -R * /usr/local/</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="mysql-lb-getting-started"></a>18.2. Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>

      </p></div><p>
      The easiest way to understand MySQL Load Balancer is to look at a
      typical example of how MySQL Load Balancer can be used to improve
      the distribution of work to multiple MySQL servers.
    </p><p>
      Given an existing setup of several replicating MySQL servers, you
      can set up the MySQL Load Balancer to provide you with
      replication-aware load distribution.
    </p><p>
      Suppose you have three slaves replicating from one master, the
      slaves running on the machines <span class="emphasis"><em>slave-1</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>slave-2</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>slave-3</em></span>,
      the master being on <span class="emphasis"><em>master-1</em></span>. Each MySQL
      server listens on the default port of 3306.
    </p><p>
      For client connectivity, typical configurations are in one of two
      topologies. The first topology uses applications that are aware of
      multiple clients and choose a MySQL server based either on a
      random selection or by choosing a slave based on a known quantity,
      such as user ID.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="mysql-lb-std1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.1. Replication architecture with clients using multiple MySQL slaves</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/stdrepl-style1.png" alt="Replication architecture with clients using
          multiple MySQL slaves"></div></div><p>
      In this scenario, it is possible for a client application to
      choose a slave that is unavailable, or in a replication situation,
      a slave that is not up to date compared to the master, or lagging
      behind the master in terms of processing replication data such
      that queries accessing the information would fail to return data,
      or return data that was out of date. In all these cases, the
      client would be unable to determine the issue (without checking
      the situation itself). In the event of a failed server, the
      connection would timeout and another server could be chosen, but
      the delay could cause problems in the application.
    </p><p>
      In this scenario, it is also possible for a single MySQL server to
      become overloaded with requests. For example, if the application
      was using an ID-based decision model to choose a MySQL server,
      then a high number of requests for a given ID could produce a very
      high load on the chosen server. This could affect the replication
      thread and place the server further behind compared to the master.
    </p><p>
      The second topology uses a model where each client has a dedicated
      MySQL server.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="mysql-lb-std2"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.2. Replication architecture with clients using dedicated MySQL slaves</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/stdrepl-style2.png" alt="Replication architecture with clients using
          dedicated MySQL slaves"></div></div><p>
      In this scenario, a problem with the MySQL server for an
      individual client could render the client useless. If the MySQL
      server is significantly behind the master, you would get out of
      date or incorrect information. If the MySQL server has failed, the
      client will be unable to access any information.
    </p><p>
      Using the MySQL Load Balancer, you can replace the individual
      connections from the clients to the slaves and instead route the
      connections through the MySQL Load Balancer. This will distribute
      the requests over the individual slave servers, automatically
      taking account of the load, and accounting for problems or delays
      in the replication of the data from the master.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="mysql-lb-stdrepl"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.3. Replication architecture with clients using MySQL Load Balancer</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/stdlb.png" alt="Replication architecture with clients using
          MySQL Load Balancer"></div></div><p>
      In the scenario using MySQL Load Balancer, any failure of a single
      MySQL server automatically removes it from the pool of available
      servers and distributes the incoming client connection to one of
      the other, available, servers. Problems with replication are
      addressed in the same way, redirecting the connection to a server
      that is up to date with the master. The possibility of overloading
      a single MySQL server should also be reduced, since the
      connections would be distributed evenly among each server.
    </p><p>
      To start the MySQL Load Balancer in this scenario you would
      specify the configuration of the master and slave servers on the
      command line when starting <span><strong class="command">mysql-lb</strong></span>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">$ bin/mysql-lb --proxy-backend-addresses=master-1 \
  --proxy-read-only-backend-addresses=slave-1:3306 \
  --proxy-read-only-backend-addresses=slave-2:3306 \
  --proxy-read-only-backend-addresses=slave-3:3306 \
  --proxy-lua-script=share/mysql-load-balancer/monitored-ro-balance.lua \
  --monitor-lua-script=share/mysql-load-balancer/monitor-backends.lua
</pre><p>
      This will start the load balancer, which listens for incoming
      client connections on port 4040. The monitor component will
      connect to each backend MySQL server with the MySQL user
      <code class="literal">monitor</code> and no password, to be able to execute
      queries on them. If you do not have a MySQL user with that name or
      have a password set for the user, you can specify those using the
      options `--monitor-username` and `--monitor-password`.
    </p><p>
      The options in this example set the following options:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          <code class="option">--proxy-backend-addresses</code> – sets the
          address and port number of the MySQL master server in the
          replication structure. This is required so that MySQL Load
          Balancer can monitor the status of the server and replication
          and use this to compare against the status of the slave
          servers. In the event of a problem, the information gained
          will be used to prioritse connections to the slaves according
          to which slave is the most up to date.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="option">--proxy-read-only-backend-addresses</code> –
          each one of these options sets the address and port number
          (separated by a colon), of a backend MySQL server. You can
          specify as many servers as you like on the command line simply
          by adding further options.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="option">--proxy-lua-script</code> – specifies the Lua
          script that will be used to manage to the distribution of
          requests.
        </p></li><li><p>
          <code class="option">--monitor-lua-script</code> – specifies the
          Lua script that will be used to monitor the backends.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      To get a list of all the available options, run
    </p><pre class="programlisting"> $ mysql-lb --help-all

      </p></div><p>
      When using the MySQL Load Balancer, you must adapt your
      application to work with the connections provided by the MySQL
      Load Balancer interface, rather than directly to MySQL servers.
      The MySQL Load Balancer supports the same MySQL network protocol -
      you do not need to change the method that you use to communicate
      with MySQL. You can continue to use the standard MySQL interface
      appropriate for your application environment.
    </p><p>
      On each client, you should configure your application to connect
      to port 4040 on the machine on which you started the MySQL Load
      Balancer. All MySQL connections for <span class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span>
      queries should be sent to the MySQL Load Balancer connection. When
      a client connects, the connection is routed by MySQL Load Balancer
      to an appropriate MySQL server. All subsequent queries on that
      connection will run be executed on the same backed MySQL server.
      The backend will not be changed after the connection has been
      established.
    </p><p>
      If MySQL Load Balancer identifies an issue with the backend MySQL
      server, then connections to the backend server are closed. Your
      application should be adapted so that it can re-open a connection
      if it closes during execution, re-executing the query again if
      there is failure. MySQL Load Balancer will then choose a different
      MySQL server for the new connection.
    </p><p>
      The thresholds with which the monitor considers a slave to be too
      far behind are specified in the
      <code class="filename">monitor-backends.lua</code> file. By default it
      checks for information obtained by <code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE
      STATUS</code>, namely <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code>
      and tries to calculate the amount of data (in bytes) the slave has
      to read from the master. The default values for those metrics are
      10 seconds and 10 kilobytes, respectively.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        You need to restart the MySQL Load Balancer if you change the
        <code class="filename">monitor-backends.lua</code> script while it is
        running. This is different from MySQL Proxy, which automatically
        reloads a script if you modify the script during execution.
      </p></div><p>
      The load balancing algorithm is specified in the
      <code class="filename">monitored-ro-balance.lua</code> script. For this
      release, it keeps a counter of how many queries each backend has
      executed and always picks the backend with the least number of
      queries. Look at <code class="literal">connect_server()</code> and
      <code class="literal">pick_ro_backend_least_queries()</code> for the code.

      For this alpha release, there are the following known issues:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Sometimes an assertion in <code class="literal">libevent</code> fails
          when shutting down <span><strong class="command">mysql-lb</strong></span>. The assertion
          failure occurs after all client and server connections have

          implication is that the backend address is not available in

            No. Currently, the MySQL Load Balancer doesn't prevent you
            from making modifications on the slaves. The read-only

            use this solution for sending quries to existing slave

            Yes. the monitor module runs <code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE

            list of available slaves for distributing queries.

            Currently we use indirect measurements and balance the
            distribution of queries by looking at the replication status
            of the slave nodes. Since the distribution of work is
