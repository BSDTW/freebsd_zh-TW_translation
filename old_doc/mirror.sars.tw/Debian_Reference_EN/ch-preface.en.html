<h1>
Debian Reference
<br>Chapter 1 - Preface
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
This <code><a href="http://qref.sourceforge.net/">Debian Reference</a></code>
is intended to provide a broad overview of the Debian system as a
post-installation user's guide.  Its target reader is someone who is willing to
read shell scripts.  I expect the reader to have gained basic skills in
Unix-like systems prior to reading this document.
</p>

<p>
I made a conscious decision <strong>not</strong> to explain everything in
detail if it can be found on a manual page, an info page, or in a HOWTO
document.  Instead of full explanations, I have tried to give more directly
practical information by providing exact command sequences in the main text or
example scripts under <code><a href="examples/">examples/</a></code>.  You must
understand the content of examples before issuing commands.  Your system may
require slightly different command sequences.
</p>

<p>
Much of the information included consists of reminders or pointers to the
authoritative references listed in <a
href="ch-support.en.html#s-references">References, Section 15.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
This document originated as a &quot;quick reference&quot; but it grew.
Nevertheless, <strong>Keep It Short and Simple</strong> (KISS) is my guiding
principle.
</p>

<p>
For help with emergency system maintenance, proceed to <a
href="ch-package.en.html#s-survival">Debian survival commands, Section 6.3</a>
immediately.
</p>

</p>

<pre>
     # command in root account
     $ command in user account
     ... description of action
</pre>

<p>
These shell command examples use <samp>PS2=&quot; &quot;</samp>.  See <a

<ul>
<li>
<p>
a UNIX-style <strong>manual page</strong> is given in the form:
<code>bash(1)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
a GNU <strong>TEXINFO page</strong> is given in the form: <samp>info
libc</samp>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
a <strong>book</strong> is given in the form: <em>The C Programming
Language</em>.
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>DDP</strong>: Debian Documentation Project (<code><a

</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other abbreviations are defined in the text before they are used.
</p>

<p>
In this document only URL references are given for LDP documents.  However, LDP
documents have been packaged for Debian; when the packages are installed the
documents are available in <code>file:///usr/share/doc/HOWTO/</code>.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="ch-support.en.html#s-references">References, Section 15.1</a>.

<h2><a name="s-examples"></a>1.3 Example scripts</h2>

<p>
<code><a href="examples/">Example scripts</a></code> which accompany this
document in the <code>debian-reference-en</code> package are available in
<code>file:///usr/share/doc/Debian/reference/examples/</code>.  The initial
&quot;.&quot; in the filenames of hidden files is converted to underscore
&quot;_&quot;.  An additional extension has been added to filenames when
several alternatives are provided.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-basic"></a>1.4 Basic setup</h2>

<p>
If the system is installed with the bare minimum of packages and you want to
make the best use of this document then it is advisable to execute the
following commands in order to install other packages containing useful
documents:
</p>

<pre>
     # aptitude install mc less ssh vim kernel-package \
                       manpages-dev doc-debian doc-linux-text \
                       debian-policy developers-reference maint-guide \
                       apt-howto harden-doc debian-reference \
                       libpam-doc glibc-doc samba-doc exim4-doc-html
</pre>

<h2><a name="s1.5"></a>1.5 Basics of the Debian distributions</h2>

<p>
Debian maintains three different distributions simultaneously.  These are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<samp>stable</samp> &mdash; Most useful for a production server since it is
only updated with security fixes.  See <a href="ch-system.en.html#s-stable">The
<samp>stable</samp> distribution, Section 2.1.3</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<samp>testing</samp> &mdash; The preferred distribution for a workstation since
it contains recent releases of desktop software which have received a bit of
testing.  See <a href="ch-system.en.html#s-testing">The <samp>testing</samp>
distribution, Section 2.1.4</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<samp>unstable</samp> &mdash; Cutting edge.  The choice of Debian developers.
See <a href="ch-system.en.html#s-unstable">The <samp>unstable</samp>
distribution, Section 2.1.5</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When packages in <samp>unstable</samp> have no release-critical (RC) bugs filed
against them after the first week or so, they are automatically promoted to
<samp>testing</samp>.
</p>

<p>
Debian distributions also have code names as described in <a
href="ch-system.en.html#s-codenames">Debian distribution codenames, Section
2.1.7</a>.  Before Sarge was released in June 2005, the three distributions
were Woody (stable), Sarge (testing), and Sid (unstable).  After Sarge was
released the three distributions were, respectively, Sarge, Etch, and Sid.
When Etch is released, the <samp>stable</samp> and <samp>unstable</samp>
distributions will be Etch and Sid; a new <samp>testing</samp> distribution
will then be created (initially as a copy of <samp>stable</samp>) and given a
new code name.
</p>

<p>
Subscribe to the low-volume mailing list
<samp>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</samp> for important announcements
about Debian.  See <a href="ch-system.en.html#s-ftparchives">The Debian
archives, Section 2.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use versions of packages that are more current than the versions
that were released with the distribution you are using, then you can either
upgrade to a later distribution as described in <a
href="ch-woody.en.html">Upgrading a distribution to <samp>stable</samp>,
<samp>testing</samp>, or <samp>unstable</samp>, Chapter 5</a>, or you can
upgrade only selected packages.  If the package can't be upgraded easily then
you may want to backport it as described in <a
href="ch-package.en.html#s-port">Port a package to the <samp>stable</samp>
system, Section 6.4.10</a>.
</p>

<p>
Tracking the <samp>testing</samp> distribution can have the side effect of
delaying the installation of packages containing security fixes.  Such packages
are uploaded to <samp>unstable</samp> and migrate to <samp>testing</samp> only
after a delay.
</p>

<p>
If you mix distributions, e.g., <samp>testing</samp> with <samp>stable</samp>
or <samp>unstable</samp> with <samp>stable</samp>, you will eventually pull in
core packages such as <code>libc6</code> from <samp>testing</samp> or
<samp>unstable</samp> and there is no guarantee that these will not contain
bugs.  You have been warned.
</p>

<p>
Running the <samp>testing</samp> or <samp>unstable</samp> distribution
increases your risk of hitting serious bugs.  This risk can be managed by
deploying a multibooting scheme with a more stable Debian distribution or by
deploying the nice trick of using <code>chroot</code> as described in <a
href="ch-tips.en.html#s-chroot"><code>chroot</code>, Section 8.6.35</a>.  The
latter will enable running different Debian distributions simultaneously on
different consoles.
</p>

<p>
After an explanation of the fundamentals of the Debian distribution in <a
href="ch-system.en.html">Debian fundamentals, Chapter 2</a>, you will be given
some basic information to help you live happily with the latest software,
taking advantage of the <samp>testing</samp> and <samp>unstable</samp>
distributions of Debian.  The impatient should proceed immediately to <a
href="ch-package.en.html#s-survival">Debian survival commands, Section 6.3</a>.
Happy upgrading!
