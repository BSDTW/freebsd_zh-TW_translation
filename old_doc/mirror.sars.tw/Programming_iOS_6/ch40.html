      <p>This book must come to an end, but your exploration of iOS will go on and on. There’s much more to know and to discover. A single book that described completely, or even introduced, every aspect of iOS programming would be immense — many times the size of this one. Inevitably, severe limits have had to be set. Having read this book, you are now in a position to investigate many further areas of iOS that this book hasn’t explored in any depth. Some of these areas have been mentioned in individual chapters; here are a few others:</p>

            <span class="term">
OpenGL
</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
An open source C library for drawing, including 3D drawing, that takes full advantage of graphics hardware. This is often the most efficient way to draw, especially when animation is involved. iOS incorporates a simplified version of OpenGL called OpenGL ES. See the <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL Programming Guide for iOS</em></span>. Open GL interface configuration, texture loading, shading, and calculation are simplified by the GLKit framework; see the <span class="emphasis"><em>GLKit Framework Reference</em></span>.

          <dt>
            <span class="term">
Accelerate
</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
Certain computation-intensive processes will benefit from the vector-based Accelerate framework. See the <span class="emphasis"><em>vDSP Programming Guide</em></span>.

            <span class="term">
Game Kit
</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
The Game Kit framework covers three areas that can enhance your user’s game experience: Wireless or Bluetooth communication directly between devices (peer-to-peer); voice communication across an existing network connection; and Game Center, a networking facility that facilitates these and many other aspects of interplayer communication, such as posting and viewing high scores and setting up combinations of players who wish to compete. See the <span class="emphasis"><em>Game Kit Programming Guide</em></span>.

            <span class="term">
Advertising
</span>
          </dt>

Security
</span>
          </dt>

Accessibility
</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
VoiceOver assists visually impaired users by describing the interface aloud. To participate, views must be configured to describe themselves usefully. Built-in views already do this to a large extent, and you can extend this functionality. See the <span class="emphasis"><em>Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS</em></span>.

            <span class="term">
Telephone
