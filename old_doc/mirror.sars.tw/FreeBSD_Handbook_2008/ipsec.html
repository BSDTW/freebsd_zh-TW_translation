<i class="AUTHORGROUP"><span class="CONTRIB">Written by</span> Hiten M. Pandya.</i> 

<p>This section will guide you through the process of setting up IPsec, and to use it in
an environment which consists of FreeBSD and <b class="APPLICATION"><span
class="TRADEMARK">Microsoft</span>&reg;&nbsp;<span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>&reg;
2000/XP</b> machines, to make them communicate securely. In order to set up IPsec, it is
necessary that you are familiar with the concepts of building a custom kernel (see <a
href="kernelconfig.html">Chapter 8</a>).</p>

<p><span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">IPsec</b></span> is a protocol which sits
on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. It allows two or more hosts to communicate in
a secure manner (hence the name). The FreeBSD IPsec “network stack” is based on the <a
href="http://www.kame.net/" target="_top">KAME</a> implementation, which has support for
both protocol families, IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> FreeBSD 5.X contains a “hardware accelerated” IPsec stack, known as
“Fast IPsec”, that was obtained from OpenBSD. It employs cryptographic hardware
(whenever possible) via the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=crypto&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">crypto</span>(4)</span></a> subsystem to
optimize the performance of IPsec. This subsystem is new, and does not support all the
features that are available in the KAME version of IPsec. However, in order to enable
hardware-accelerated IPsec, the following kernel option has to be added to your kernel
configuration file:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
options      FAST_IPSEC  # new IPsec (cannot define w/ IPSEC)
       
</pre>

<p>Note, that it is not currently possible to use the “Fast IPsec” subsystem in lue
with the KAME implementation of IPsec. Consult the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fast_ipsec&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">fast_ipsec</span>(4)</span></a> manual
page for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>IPsec consists of two sub-protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">Encapsulated Security Payload
(ESP)</b></span>, protects the IP packet data from third party interference, by
encrypting the contents using symmetric cryptography algorithms (like Blowfish,
3DES).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">Authentication Header (AH)</b></span>,
protects the IP packet header from third party interference and spoofing, by computing a
cryptographic checksum and hashing the IP packet header fields with a secure hashing
function. This is then followed by an additional header that contains the hash, to allow
the information in the packet to be authenticated.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><acronym class="ACRONYM">ESP</acronym> and <acronym class="ACRONYM">AH</acronym> can
either be used together or separately, depending on the environment.</p>

<p>IPsec can either be used to directly encrypt the traffic between two hosts (known as
<span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">Transport Mode</b></span>); or to build
“virtual tunnels” between two subnets, which could be used for secure communication
between two corporate networks (known as <span class="emphasis"><b
class="EMPHASIS">Tunnel Mode</b></span>). The latter is more commonly known as a <span
class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b></span>. The <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipsec&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ipsec</span>(4)</span></a> manual page
should be consulted for detailed information on the IPsec subsystem in FreeBSD.</p>

<p>To add IPsec support to your kernel, add the following options to your kernel
configuration file:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
options   IPSEC        #IP security
options   IPSEC_ESP    #IP security (crypto; define w/ IPSEC)
     
</pre>

<p>If IPsec debugging support is desired, the following kernel option should also be
added:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
options   IPSEC_DEBUG  #debug for IP security
     
</pre>

<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN20153" name="AEN20153">14.10.2 The Problem</a></h2>

<p>There is no standard for what constitutes a VPN. VPNs can be implemented using a
number of different technologies, each of which have their own strengths and weaknesses.
This section presents a scenario, and the strategies used for implementing a VPN for this
scenario.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN20156" name="AEN20156">14.10.3 The Scenario: Two networks,
connected to the Internet, to behave as one</a></h2>

<p>The premise is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You have at least two sites</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Both sites are using IP internally</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Both sites are connected to the Internet, through a gateway that is running
FreeBSD.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The gateway on each network has at least one public IP address.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The internal addresses of the two networks can be public or private IP addresses, it
does not matter. You can be running NAT on the gateway machine if necessary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The internal IP addresses of the two networks <span class="emphasis"><b
class="EMPHASIS">do not collide</b></span>. While I expect it is theoretically possible
to use a combination of VPN technology and NAT to get this to work, I expect it to be a
configuration nightmare.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find that you are trying to connect two networks, both of which, internally,
use the same private IP address range (e.g. both of them use <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.1.x</tt>), then one of the networks will have to be
renumbered.</p>

<p>The network topology might look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="security/ipsec-network.png" align="CENTER" /></p>

<p>Notice the two public IP addresses. I will use the letters to refer to them in the
rest of this article. Anywhere you see those letters in this article, replace them with
your own public IP addresses. Note also that internally, the two gateway machines have .1
IP addresses, and that the two networks have different private IP addresses (<tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.1.x</tt> and <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.2.x</tt> respectively).
All the machines on the private networks have been configured to use the <tt
class="HOSTID">.1</tt> machine as their default gateway.</p>

<p>The intention is that, from a network point of view, each network should view the
machines on the other network as though they were directly attached the same router --
albeit a slightly slow router with an occasional tendency to drop packets.</p>

<p>This means that (for example), machine <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.1.20</tt> should be
able to run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ping 192.168.2.34
</pre>

<p>and have it work, transparently. <span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span> machines
should be able to see the machines on the other network, browse file shares, and so on,
in exactly the same way that they can browse machines on the local network.</p>

<p>And the whole thing has to be secure. This means that traffic between the two networks
has to be encrypted.</p>

<p>Creating a VPN between these two networks is a multi-step process. The stages are as
follows:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Create a “virtual” network link between the two networks, across the Internet. Test
it, using tools like <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ping</span>(8)</span></a>, to make sure
it works.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Apply security policies to ensure that traffic between the two networks is
transparently encrypted and decrypted as necessary. Test this, using tools like <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tcpdump</span>(1)</span></a>, to ensure
that traffic is encrypted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Configure additional software on the FreeBSD gateways, to allow <span
class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span> machines to see one another across the VPN.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN20211" name="AEN20211">14.10.3.1 Step 1: Creating and testing
a “virtual” network link</a></h3>

<p>Suppose that you were logged in to the gateway machine on network #1 (with public IP
address <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>, private IP address <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.1.1</tt>), and you ran <tt class="COMMAND">ping 192.168.2.1</tt>,
which is the private address of the machine with IP address <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>. What needs to happen in order for this to work?</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The gateway machine needs to know how to reach <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt>. In
other words, it needs to have a route to <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Private IP addresses, such as those in the <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.x</tt> range are
not supposed to appear on the Internet at large. Instead, each packet you send to <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt> will need to be wrapped up inside another packet. This
packet will need to appear to be from <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>, and it will have
to be sent to <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>. This process is called <i
class="FIRSTTERM">encapsulation</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once this packet arrives at <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt> it will need to
“unencapsulated”, and delivered to <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can think of this as requiring a “tunnel” between the two networks. The two
“tunnel mouths” are the IP addresses <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt> and <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, and the tunnel must be told the addresses of the private IP
addresses that will be allowed to pass through it. The tunnel is used to transfer traffic
with private IP addresses across the public Internet.</p>

<p>This tunnel is created by using the generic interface, or <tt
class="DEVICENAME">gif</tt> devices on FreeBSD. As you can imagine, the <tt
class="DEVICENAME">gif</tt> interface on each gateway host must be configured with four
IP addresses; two for the public IP addresses, and two for the private IP addresses.</p>

<p>Support for the gif device must be compiled in to the FreeBSD kernel on both machines.
You can do this by adding the line:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
device gif
</pre>

<p>to the kernel configuration files on both machines, and then compile, install, and
reboot as normal.</p>

<p>Configuring the tunnel is a two step process. First the tunnel must be told what the
outside (or public) IP addresses are, using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gifconfig&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">gifconfig</span>(8)</span></a>. Then the
private IP addresses must be configured using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ifconfig</span>(8)</span></a>.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> In FreeBSD&nbsp;5.X, the functionality provided by the <a

class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ifconfig</span>(8)</span></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>On the gateway machine on network #1 you would run the following two commands to
configure the tunnel.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
gifconfig gif0 A.B.C.D W.X.Y.Z
ifconfig gif0 inet 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffffff
     
</pre>

<p>On the other gateway machine you run the same commands, but with the order of the IP
addresses reversed.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
gifconfig gif0 W.X.Y.Z A.B.C.D
ifconfig gif0 inet 192.168.2.1 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffffff
     
</pre>

<p>You can then run:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
gifconfig gif0
</pre>

<p>to see the configuration. For example, on the network #1 gateway, you would see
this:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">gifconfig gif0</kbd>
gif0: flags=8011&lt;UP,POINTTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280
inet 192.168.1.1 --&gt; 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffffff
physical address inet A.B.C.D --&gt; W.X.Y.Z
     
</pre>

<p>As you can see, a tunnel has been created between the physical addresses <tt
class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt> and <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, and the traffic allowed
through the tunnel is that between <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.1.1</tt> and <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt>.</p>

<p>This will also have added an entry to the routing table on both machines, which you
can examine with the command <tt class="COMMAND">netstat -rn</tt>. This output is from
the gateway host on network #1.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">netstat -rn</kbd>
Routing tables
 
Internet:
Destination      Gateway       Flags    Refs    Use    Netif  Expire
...
192.168.2.1      192.168.1.1   UH        0        0    gif0
...
     
</pre>

<p>As the “Flags” value indicates, this is a host route, which means that each gateway
knows how to reach the other gateway, but they do not know how to reach the rest of their
respective networks. That problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>It is likely that you are running a firewall on both machines. This will need to be
circumvented for your VPN traffic. You might want to allow all traffic between both
networks, or you might want to include firewall rules that protect both ends of the VPN
from one another.</p>

<p>It greatly simplifies testing if you configure the firewall to allow all traffic
through the VPN. You can always tighten things up later. If you are using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ipfw</span>(8)</span></a> on the gateway
machines then a command like</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ipfw add 1 allow ip from any to any via gif0
</pre>

<p>will allow all traffic between the two end points of the VPN, without affecting your
other firewall rules. Obviously you will need to run this command on both gateway
hosts.</p>

<p>This is sufficient to allow each gateway machine to ping the other. On <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.1.1</tt>, you should be able to run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ping 192.168.2.1
</pre>

<p>and get a response, and you should be able to do the same thing on the other gateway
machine.</p>

<p>However, you will not be able to reach internal machines on either network yet. This
is because of the routing -- although the gateway machines know how to reach one another,
they do not know how to reach the network behind each one.</p>

<p>To solve this problem you must add a static route on each gateway machine. The command
to do this on the first gateway would be:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
route add 192.168.2.0 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00
     
</pre>

<p>This says “In order to reach the hosts on the network <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.2.0</tt>, send the packets to the host <tt
class="HOSTID">192.168.2.1</tt>”. You will need to run a similar command on the other
gateway, but with the <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.1.x</tt> addresses instead.</p>

<p>IP traffic from hosts on one network will now be able to reach hosts on the other
network.</p>

<p>That has now created two thirds of a VPN between the two networks, in as much as it is
“virtual” and it is a “network”. It is not private yet. You can test this using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ping</span>(8)</span></a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tcpdump</span>(1)</span></a>. Log in to
the gateway host and run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
tcpdump dst host 192.168.2.1
</pre>

<p>In another log in session on the same host run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ping 192.168.2.1
</pre>

<p>You will see output that looks something like this:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
16:10:24.018080 192.168.1.1 &gt; 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo request

16:10:26.029112 192.168.1.1 &gt; 192.168.2.1: icmp: echo reply
     
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the ICMP messages are going back and forth unencrypted. If you had
used the <code class="OPTION">-s</code> parameter to <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tcpdump</span>(1)</span></a> to grab
more bytes of data from the packets you would see more information.</p>

<p>Obviously this is unacceptable. The next section will discuss securing the link
between the two networks so that it all traffic is automatically encrypted.</p>

<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN20340" name="AEN20340">14.10.3.2 Step 2: Securing the
link</a></h3>

<p>To secure the link we will be using IPsec. IPsec provides a mechanism for two hosts to
agree on an encryption key, and to then use this key in order to encrypt data between the
two hosts.</p>

<p>The are two areas of configuration to be considered here.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>There must be a mechanism for two hosts to agree on the encryption mechanism to use.
Once two hosts have agreed on this mechanism there is said to be a “security
association” between them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There must be a mechanism for specifying which traffic should be encrypted. Obviously,
you do not want to encrypt all your outgoing traffic -- you only want to encrypt the
traffic that is part of the VPN. The rules that you put in place to determine what
traffic will be encrypted are called “security policies”.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Security associations and security policies are both maintained by the kernel, and can
be modified by userland programs. However, before you can do this you must configure the
kernel to support IPsec and the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) protocol. This is
done by configuring a kernel with:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options IPSEC
options IPSEC_ESP
      
</pre>

<p>and recompiling, reinstalling, and rebooting. As before you will need to do this to
the kernels on both of the gateway hosts.</p>

<p>You have two choices when it comes to setting up security associations. You can
configure them by hand between two hosts, which entails choosing the encryption
algorithm, encryption keys, and so forth, or you can use daemons that implement the
Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to do this for you.</p>

<p>I recommend the latter. Apart from anything else, it is easier to set up.</p>

<p>Editing and displaying security policies is carried out using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setkey&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setkey</span>(8)</span></a>. By analogy,
<tt class="COMMAND">setkey</tt> is to the kernel's security policy tables as <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=route&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">route</span>(8)</span></a> is to the
kernel's routing tables. <tt class="COMMAND">setkey</tt> can also display the current
security associations, and to continue the analogy further, is akin to <tt
class="COMMAND">netstat -r</tt> in that respect.</p>

<p>There are a number of choices for daemons to manage security associations with
FreeBSD. This article will describe how to use one of these, racoon&nbsp;—— which is
available from <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/security/ipsec-tools/pkg-descr"><tt
class="FILENAME">security/ipsec-tools</tt></a> in the FreeBSD Ports collection.</p>

<p>The <b class="APPLICATION">racoon</b> software must be run on both gateway hosts. On
each host it is configured with the IP address of the other end of the VPN, and a secret
key (which you choose, and must be the same on both gateways).</p>

<p>The two daemons then contact one another, confirm that they are who they say they are
(by using the secret key that you configured). The daemons then generate a new secret
key, and use this to encrypt the traffic over the VPN. They periodically change this
secret, so that even if an attacker were to crack one of the keys (which is as
theoretically close to unfeasible as it gets) it will not do them much good -- by the
time they have cracked the key the two daemons have chosen another one.</p>

<p>The configuration file for racoon is stored in <tt
class="FILENAME">${PREFIX}/etc/racoon</tt>. You should find a configuration file there,
which should not need to be changed too much. The other component of racoon's
configuration, which you will need to change, is the “pre-shared key”.</p>

<p>The default racoon configuration expects to find this in the file <tt
class="FILENAME">${PREFIX}/etc/racoon/psk.txt</tt>. It is important to note that the
pre-shared key is <span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">not</b></span> the key that
will be used to encrypt your traffic across the VPN link, it is simply a token that
allows the key management daemons to trust one another.</p>

<p><tt class="FILENAME">psk.txt</tt> contains a line for each remote site you are dealing
with. In this example, where there are two sites, each <tt class="FILENAME">psk.txt</tt>
file will contain one line (because each end of the VPN is only dealing with one other
end).</p>

<p>On gateway host #1 this line should look like this:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
W.X.Y.Z            secret
</pre>

<p>That is, the <span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">public</b></span> IP address
of the remote end, whitespace, and a text string that provides the secret. Obviously, you
should not use “secret” as your key -- the normal rules for choosing a password
apply.</p>

<p>On gateway host #2 the line would look like this</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
A.B.C.D            secret
</pre>

<p>That is, the public IP address of the remote end, and the same secret key. <tt
class="FILENAME">psk.txt</tt> must be mode <tt class="LITERAL">0600</tt> (i.e., only
read/write to <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt>) before racoon will run.</p>

<p>You must run racoon on both gateway machines. You will also need to add some firewall
rules to allow the IKE traffic, which is carried over UDP to the ISAKMP (Internet
Security Association Key Management Protocol) port. Again, this should be fairly early in
your firewall ruleset.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ipfw add 1 allow udp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z isakmp
ipfw add 1 allow udp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D isakmp
      
</pre>

<p>Once racoon is running you can try pinging one gateway host from the other. The
connection is still not encrypted, but racoon will then set up the security associations
between the two hosts -- this might take a moment, and you may see this as a short delay
before the ping commands start responding.</p>

<p>Once the security association has been set up you can view it using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setkey&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setkey</span>(8)</span></a>. Run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
setkey -D
</pre>

<p>on either host to view the security association information.</p>

<p>That's one half of the problem. They other half is setting your security policies.</p>

<p>To create a sensible security policy, let's review what's been set up so far. This
discussions hold for both ends of the link.</p>

<p>Each IP packet that you send out has a header that contains data about the packet. The
header includes the IP addresses of both the source and destination. As we already know,
private IP addresses, such as the <tt class="HOSTID">192.168.x.y</tt> range are not
supposed to appear on the public Internet. Instead, they must first be encapsulated
inside another packet. This packet must have the public source and destination IP
addresses substituted for the private addresses.</p>

<p>So if your outgoing packet started looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="security/ipsec-out-pkt.png" align="CENTER" /></p>

<p>Then it will be encapsulated inside another packet, looking something like this:</p>

<p><img src="security/ipsec-encap-pkt.png" align="CENTER" /></p>

<p>This encapsulation is carried out by the <tt class="DEVICENAME">gif</tt> device. As
you can see, the packet now has real IP addresses on the outside, and our original packet
has been wrapped up as data inside the packet that will be put out on the Internet.</p>

<p>Obviously, we want all traffic between the VPNs to be encrypted. You might try putting
this in to words, as:</p>

<p>“If a packet leaves from <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>, and it is destined for <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, then encrypt it, using the necessary security
associations.”</p>

<p>“If a packet arrives from <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, and it is destined for <tt
class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>, then decrypt it, using the necessary security
associations.”</p>

<p>That's close, but not quite right. If you did this, all traffic to and from <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, even traffic that was not part of the VPN, would be
encrypted. That's not quite what you want. The correct policy is as follows</p>

<p>“If a packet leaves from <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>, and that packet is
encapsulating another packet, and it is destined for <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>,
then encrypt it, using the necessary security associations.”</p>

<p>“If a packet arrives from <tt class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>, and that packet is
encapsulating another packet, and it is destined for <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>,
then decrypt it, using the necessary security associations.”</p>

<p>A subtle change, but a necessary one.</p>

<p>Security policies are also set using <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setkey&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setkey</span>(8)</span></a>. <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setkey&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setkey</span>(8)</span></a> features a
configuration language for defining the policy. You can either enter configuration
instructions via stdin, or you can use the <code class="OPTION">-f</code> option to
specify a filename that contains configuration instructions.</p>

<p>The configuration on gateway host #1 (which has the public IP address <tt
class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt>) to force all outbound traffic to <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt> to be encrypted is:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P out ipsec esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
      
</pre>

<p>Put these commands in a file (e.g. <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>) and then
run</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">setkey -f /etc/ipsec.conf</kbd>
</pre>

<p><code class="OPTION">spdadd</code> tells <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setkey&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setkey</span>(8)</span></a> that we want
to add a rule to the secure policy database. The rest of this line specifies which
packets will match this policy. <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D/32</tt> and <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z/32</tt> are the IP addresses and netmasks that identify the
network or hosts that this policy will apply to. In this case, we want it to apply to
traffic between these two hosts. <code class="OPTION">ipencap</code> tells the kernel
that this policy should only apply to packets that encapsulate other packets. <code
class="OPTION">-P out</code> says that this policy applies to outgoing packets, and <code
class="OPTION">ipsec</code> says that the packet will be secured.</p>

<p>The second line specifies how this packet will be encrypted. <code
class="OPTION">esp</code> is the protocol that will be used, while <code
class="OPTION">tunnel</code> indicates that the packet will be further encapsulated in an
IPsec packet. The repeated use of <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt> and <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt> is used to select the security association to use, and the
final <code class="OPTION">require</code> mandates that packets must be encrypted if they
match this rule.</p>

<p>This rule only matches outgoing packets. You will need a similar rule to match
incoming packets.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P in ipsec esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
</pre>

<p>Note the <code class="OPTION">in</code> instead of <code class="OPTION">out</code> in
this case, and the necessary reversal of the IP addresses.</p>

<p>The other gateway host (which has the public IP address <tt
class="HOSTID">W.X.Y.Z</tt>) will need similar rules.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P out ipsec esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P in ipsec esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
</pre>

<p>Finally, you need to add firewall rules to allow ESP and IPENCAP packets back and
forth. These rules will need to be added to both hosts.</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ipfw add 1 allow esp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
ipfw add 1 allow esp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
      
</pre>

<p>Because the rules are symmetric you can use the same rules on each gateway host.</p>

<p>Outgoing packets will now look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="security/ipsec-crypt-pkt.png" align="CENTER" /></p>

<p>When they are received by the far end of the VPN they will first be decrypted (using
the security associations that have been negotiated by racoon). Then they will enter the
<tt class="DEVICENAME">gif</tt> interface, which will unwrap the second layer, until you
are left with the innermost packet, which can then travel in to the inner network.</p>

<p>You can check the security using the same <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ping</span>(8)</span></a> test from
earlier. First, log in to the <tt class="HOSTID">A.B.C.D</tt> gateway machine, and
run:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
tcpdump dst host 192.168.2.1
</pre>

<p>In another log in session on the same host run</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ping 192.168.2.1
</pre>

<p>This time you should see output like the following:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
XXX tcpdump output
</pre>

<p>Now, as you can see, <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tcpdump</span>(1)</span></a> shows the
ESP packets. If you try to examine them with the <code class="OPTION">-s</code> option
you will see (apparently) gibberish, because of the encryption.</p>

<p>Congratulations. You have just set up a VPN between two remote sites.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Configure both kernels with:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
options IPSEC
options IPSEC_ESP
         
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Install <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/security/ipsec-tools/pkg-descr"><tt
class="FILENAME">security/ipsec-tools</tt></a>. Edit <tt
class="FILENAME">${PREFIX}/etc/racoon/psk.txt</tt> on both gateway hosts, adding an entry
for the remote host's IP address and a secret key that they both know. Make sure this
file is mode 0600.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add the following lines to <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/rc.conf</tt> on each host:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ipsec_enable="YES"
ipsec_file="/etc/ipsec.conf"
         
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create an <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/ipsec.conf</tt> on each host that contains the
necessary spdadd lines. On gateway host #1 this would be:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P out ipsec
  esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P in ipsec
  esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
</pre>

<p>On gateway host #2 this would be:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
spdadd W.X.Y.Z/32 A.B.C.D/32 ipencap -P out ipsec
  esp/tunnel/W.X.Y.Z-A.B.C.D/require;
spdadd A.B.C.D/32 W.X.Y.Z/32 ipencap -P in ipsec
  esp/tunnel/A.B.C.D-W.X.Y.Z/require;
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add firewall rules to allow IKE, ESP, and IPENCAP traffic to both hosts:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
ipfw add 1 allow udp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z isakmp
ipfw add 1 allow udp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D isakmp
ipfw add 1 allow esp from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
ipfw add 1 allow esp from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from A.B.C.D to W.X.Y.Z
ipfw add 1 allow ipencap from W.X.Y.Z to A.B.C.D
         
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous two steps should suffice to get the VPN up and running. Machines on each
network will be able to refer to one another using IP addresses, and all traffic across
the link will be automatically and securely encrypted.</p>
