<p>The following section covers basic installation troubleshooting, such as common
problems people have reported. There are also a few questions and answers for people
wishing to dual-boot FreeBSD with <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg; or <span

<p>Due to various limitations of the PC architecture, it is impossible for probing to be
100% reliable, however, there are a few things you can do if it fails.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/index.html" target="_top">Hardware
Notes</a> document for your version of FreeBSD to make sure your hardware is
supported.</p>

<p>若硬體有在支援清單內，但使用 <tt class="FILENAME">GENERIC</tt> kernel
仍有問題，那麼就可能需要 <a href="kernelconfig.html">自訂
kernel</a>，以加入有支援的硬體。 The kernel on the boot disks is configured assuming that
most hardware devices are in their factory default configuration in terms of IRQs, IO
addresses, and DMA channels. If your hardware has been reconfigured, you will most likely
need to edit the kernel configuration and recompile to tell FreeBSD where to find
things.</p>

<p>It is also possible that a probe for a device not present will cause a later probe for
another device that is present to fail. In that case, the probes for the conflicting
driver(s) should be disabled.</p>

class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>&reg; and <span class="TRADEMARK">Windows</span>&reg; File
Systems</a></h2>

<p>At this time, FreeBSD does not support file systems compressed with the <b
class="APPLICATION">Double Space&trade;</b> application. Therefore the file system will
need to be uncompressed before FreeBSD can access the data. This can be done by running
the <b class="APPLICATION">Compression Agent</b> located in the <span
class="GUIMENUITEM">Start</span>&gt; <span class="GUIMENUITEM">Programs</span> &gt; <span
class="GUIMENUITEM">System Tools</span> menu.</p>

<p>FreeBSD can support <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> based file systems(FAT16 and
FAT32). This requires you use the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_msdosfs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mount_msdosfs</span>(8)</span></a>
command with the required parameters. The utility most common usage is:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">mount -t msdosfs /dev/ad0s1 /mnt</kbd>
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> file system is located on
the first partition of the primary hard disk. Your situation may be different, check the
output from the <tt class="COMMAND">dmesg</tt>, and <tt class="COMMAND">mount</tt>
commands. They should produce enough information to give an idea of the partition
layout.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Extended <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span> file systems are usually
mapped after the FreeBSD partitions. In other words, the slice number may be higher than
the ones FreeBSD is using. For instance, the first <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>
partition may be <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/ad0s1</tt>, the FreeBSD partition may be <tt
class="FILENAME">/dev/ad0s2</tt>, with the extended <span class="TRADEMARK">MS-DOS</span>
partition being located on <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/ad0s3</tt>. To some, this can be
confusing at first.</p>

<p>NTFS partitions can also be mounted in a similar manner using the <a

</div>

<div class="ANSWER">
<p><b></b>FreeBSD 5.0 and above makes extensive use of the system ACPI service on the
i386, amd64 and ia64 platforms to aid in system configuration if it's detected during
boot. Unfortunately, some bugs still exist in both the ACPI driver and within system
motherboards and BIOS. The use of ACPI can be disabled by setting the <tt
class="LITERAL">hint.acpi.0.disabled</tt> hint in the third stage boot loader:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
set hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
</pre>

<p>This is reset each time the system is booted, so it is necessary to add <tt
class="LITERAL">hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"</tt> to the file <tt
class="FILENAME">/boot/loader.conf</tt>. More information about the boot loader can be
found in <a href="boot.html#BOOT-SYNOPSIS">Section 12.1</a>.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">

</pre>

<p>What is wrong? What can I do?</p>

<p>What is this <tt class="LITERAL">bios_drive:interface(unit,partition)kernel_name</tt>
thing that is displayed with the boot help?</p>
</div>

<div class="ANSWER">
<p><b></b>There is a longstanding problem in the case where the boot disk is not the
first disk in the system. The BIOS uses a different numbering scheme to FreeBSD, and
working out which numbers correspond to which is difficult to get right.</p>

<p>In the case where the boot disk is not the first disk in the system, FreeBSD can need
some help finding it. There are two common situations here, and in both of these cases,
you need to tell FreeBSD where the root filesystem is. You do this by specifying the BIOS
disk number, the disk type and the FreeBSD disk number for that type.</p>

<p>The first situation is where you have two IDE disks, each configured as the master on
their respective IDE busses, and wish to boot FreeBSD from the second disk. The BIOS sees
these as disk 0 and disk 1, while FreeBSD sees them as <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad0</tt>
and <tt class="DEVICENAME">ad2</tt>.</p>

<p>FreeBSD is on BIOS disk 1, of type <tt class="LITERAL">ad</tt> and the FreeBSD disk
number is 2, so you would say:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<kbd class="USERINPUT">1:ad(2,a)kernel</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Note that if you have a slave on the primary bus, the above is not necessary (and is
effectively wrong).</p>

<p>The second situation involves booting from a SCSI disk when you have one or more IDE
disks in the system. In this case, the FreeBSD disk number is lower than the BIOS disk
number. If you have two IDE disks as well as the SCSI disk, the SCSI disk is BIOS disk 2,
type <tt class="LITERAL">da</tt> and FreeBSD disk number 0, so you would say:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<kbd class="USERINPUT">2:da(0,a)kernel</kbd>
</pre>

<p>To tell FreeBSD that you want to boot from BIOS disk 2, which is the first SCSI disk
in the system. If you only had one IDE disk, you would use '1:' instead.</p>

<p>Once you have determined the correct values to use, you can put the command exactly as
you would have typed it in the <tt class="FILENAME">/boot.config</tt> file using a
standard text editor. Unless instructed otherwise, FreeBSD will use the contents of this
file as the default response to the <tt class="LITERAL">boot:</tt> prompt.</p>

<tt class="LITERAL">F?</tt> at the boot menu each time but the boot won't go any

</div>

<div class="ANSWER">
<p><b></b>The hard disk geometry was set incorrectly in the Partition editor when you
installed FreeBSD. Go back into the partition editor and specify the actual geometry of
your hard disk. You must reinstall FreeBSD again from the beginning with the correct
geometry.</p>

<p>If you are failing entirely in figuring out the correct geometry for your machine,
here's a tip: Install a small DOS partition at the beginning of the disk and install
FreeBSD after that. The install program will see the DOS partition and try to infer the
correct geometry from it, which usually works.</p>

<p>The following tip is no longer recommended, but is left here for reference:</p>

<a id="AEN2991" name="AEN2991"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>If you are setting up a truly dedicated FreeBSD server or workstation where you don't
care for (future) compatibility with DOS, Linux or another operating system, you've also
got the option to use the entire disk (`A' in the partition editor), selecting the
non-standard option where FreeBSD occupies the entire disk from the very first to the
very last sector. This will leave all geometry considerations aside, but is somewhat
limiting unless you're never going to run anything other than FreeBSD on a disk.</p>

<p><a id="Q2.11.3.4." name="Q2.11.3.4."></a><b>2.11.3.4.</b> The system finds my <span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">ed</span>(4)</span> network card, but I

</div>

<div class="ANSWER">
<p><b></b>Your card is probably on a different IRQ from what is specified in the <tt
class="FILENAME">/boot/device.hints</tt> file. The ed driver does not use the `soft'
configuration by default (values entered using EZSETUP in DOS), but it will use the
software configuration if you specify <tt class="LITERAL">-1</tt> in the hints for the
interface.</p>

<p>Either move the jumper on the card to a hard configuration setting (altering the
kernel settings if necessary), or specify the IRQ as <tt class="LITERAL">-1</tt> by
setting the hint “hint.ed.0.irq="-1"” This will tell the kernel to use the soft
configuration.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that your card is at IRQ 9, which is shared by IRQ 2 and
frequently a cause of problems (especially when you have a VGA card using IRQ 2!). You
should not use IRQ 2 or 9 if at all possible.</p>
