Understanding MAC Labels</a></h1>

<p>A <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> label is a security attribute which may be
applied to subjects and objects throughout the system.</p>

<p>When setting a label, the user must be able to comprehend what it is, exactly, that is
being done. The attributes available on an object depend on the policy module loaded, and
that policy modules interpret their attributes in different ways. If improperly
configured due to lack of comprehension, or the inability to understand the implications,
the result will be the unexpected and perhaps, undesired, behavior of the system.</p>

<p>The security label on an object is used as a part of a security access control
decision by a policy. With some policies, the label by itself contains all information
necessary to make a decision; in other models, the labels may be processed as part of a
larger rule set, etc.</p>

<p>For instance, setting the label of <tt class="LITERAL">biba/low</tt> on a file will
represent a label maintained by the Biba security policy module, with a value of
“low”.</p>

<p>A few policy modules which support the labeling feature in FreeBSD offer three
specific predefined labels. These are the low, high, and equal labels. Although they
enforce access control in a different manner with each policy module, you can be sure
that the low label will be the lowest setting, the equal label will set the subject or
object to be disabled or unaffected, and the high label will enforce the highest setting
available in the Biba and <acronym class="ACRONYM">MLS</acronym> policy modules.</p>

<p>Within single label file system environments, only one label may be used on objects.
This will enforce one set of access permissions across the entire system and in many
environments may be all that is required. There are a few cases where multiple labels may
be set on objects or subjects in the file system. For those cases, the <code
class="OPTION">multilabel</code> option may be passed to <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tunefs&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">tunefs</span>(8)</span></a>.</p>

<p>In the case of Biba and <acronym class="ACRONYM">MLS</acronym>, a numeric label may be
set to indicate the precise level of hierarchical control. This numeric level is used to
partition or sort information into different groups of say, classification only
permitting access to that group or a higher group level.</p>

<p>In most cases the administrator will only be setting up a single label to use
throughout the file system.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis"><b class="EMPHASIS">Hey wait, this is similar to <acronym
class="ACRONYM">DAC</acronym>! I thought <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> gave
control strictly to the administrator.</b></span> That statement still holds true, to
some extent as <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> is the one in control and who configures
the policies so that users are placed in the appropriate categories/access levels. Alas,
many policy modules can restrict the <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> user as well. Basic
control over objects will then be released to the group, but <tt
class="USERNAME">root</tt> may revoke or modify the settings at any time. This is the
hierarchal/clearance model covered by policies such as Biba and <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MLS</acronym>.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN22104" name="AEN22104">16.4.1 Label Configuration</a></h2>

<p>Virtually all aspects of label policy module configuration will be performed using the
base system utilities. These commands provide a simple interface for object or subject
configuration or the manipulation and verification of the configuration.</p>

<p>All configuration may be done by use of the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setfmac&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setfmac</span>(8)</span></a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=setpmac&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">setpmac</span>(8)</span></a> utilities.
The <tt class="COMMAND">setfmac</tt> command is used to set <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> labels on system objects while the <tt
class="COMMAND">setpmac</tt> command is used to set the labels on system subjects.
Observe:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">setfmac biba/high test</kbd>
</pre>

<p>If no errors occurred with the command above, a prompt will be returned. The only time
these commands are not quiescent is when an error occurred; similarly to the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=chmod&amp;sektion=1"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">chmod</span>(1)</span></a> and <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=chown&amp;sektion=8"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">chown</span>(8)</span></a> commands. In
some cases this error may be a “<tt class="ERRORNAME">Permission denied</tt>” and is
usually obtained when the label is being set or modified on an object which is
restricted.<a id="AEN22128" name="AEN22128" href="#FTN.AEN22128"><span
class="footnote">[1]</span></a> The system administrator may use the following commands
to overcome this:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">setfmac biba/high test</kbd>
“<tt class="ERRORNAME">Permission denied</tt>”
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">setpmac biba/low setfmac biba/high test</kbd>
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">getfmac test</kbd>
test: biba/high
</pre>

<p>As we see above, <tt class="COMMAND">setpmac</tt> can be used to override the policy
module's settings by assigning a different label to the invoked process. The <tt
class="COMMAND">getpmac</tt> utility is usually used with currently running processes,
such as <b class="APPLICATION">sendmail</b>: although it takes a process ID in place of a
command the logic is extremely similar. If users attempt to manipulate a file not in
their access, subject to the rules of the loaded policy modules, the “<tt
class="ERRORNAME">Operation not permitted</tt>” error will be displayed by the <code
class="FUNCTION">mac_set_link</code> function.</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN22144" name="AEN22144">16.4.1.1 Common Label Types</a></h3>

<p>For the <a

class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_biba</span>(4)</span></a>, <a

class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">mac_lomac</span>(4)</span></a> policy
modules, the ability to assign simple labels is provided. These take the form of high,
equal and low, what follows is a brief description of what these labels provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">low</tt> label is considered the lowest label setting an
object or subject may have. Setting this on objects or subjects will block their access
to objects or subjects marked high.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">equal</tt> label should only be placed on objects considered
to be exempt from the policy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">high</tt> label grants an object or subject the highest
possible setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to each policy module, each of those settings will instate a different
information flow directive. Reading the proper manual pages will further explain the
traits of these generic label configurations.</p>

<div class="SECT4">
<h4 class="SECT4"><a id="AEN22167" name="AEN22167">16.4.1.1.1 Advanced Label
Configuration</a></h4>

<p>Numeric grade numbers used for <tt
class="LITERAL">comparison:compartment+compartment</tt>; thus the following:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
biba/10:2+3+6(5:2+3-20:2+3+4+5+6)
</pre>

<p>May be interpreted as:</p>

<p>“Biba Policy Label”/“Grade 10” :“Compartments 2, 3 and 6”: (“grade 5 ...”)</p>

<p>In this example, the first grade would be considered the “effective grade” with
“effective compartments”, the second grade is the low grade and the last one is the
high grade. In most configurations these settings will not be used; indeed, they offered
for more advanced configurations.</p>

<p>When applied to system objects, they will only have a current grade/compartments as
opposed to system subjects as they reflect the range of available rights in the system,
and network interfaces, where they are used for access control.</p>

<p>The grade and compartments in a subject and object pair are used to construct a
relationship referred to as “dominance”, in which a subject dominates an object, the
object dominates the subject, neither dominates the other, or both dominate each other.
The “both dominate” case occurs when the two labels are equal. Due to the information
flow nature of Biba, you have rights to a set of compartments, “need to know”, that
might correspond to projects, but objects also have a set of compartments. Users may have
to subset their rights using <tt class="COMMAND">su</tt> or <tt
class="COMMAND">setpmac</tt> in order to access objects in a compartment from which they
are not restricted.</p>

</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN22188" name="AEN22188">16.4.1.2 Users and Label
Settings</a></h3>

<p>Users themselves are required to have labels so that their files and processes may
properly interact with the security policy defined on the system. This is configured
through the <tt class="FILENAME">login.conf</tt> file by use of login classes. Every
policy module that uses labels will implement the user class setting.</p>

<p>An example entry containing every policy module setting is displayed below:</p>

<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
default:\
    :copyright=/etc/COPYRIGHT:\
    :welcome=/etc/motd:\
    :setenv=MAIL=/var/mail/$,BLOCKSIZE=K:\
    :path=~/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:\

</pre>

<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">label</tt> option is used to set the user class default label
which will be enforced by <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym>. Users will never be
permitted to modify this value, thus it can be considered not optional in the user case.
In a real configuration, however, the administrator will never wish to enable every
policy module. It is recommended that the rest of this chapter be reviewed before any of
this configuration is implemented.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Users may change their label after the initial login; however, this
change is subject constraints of the policy. The example above tells the Biba policy that
a process's minimum integrity is 5, its maximum is 15, but the default effective label is
10. The process will run at 10 until it chooses to change label, perhaps due to the user
using the setpmac command, which will be constrained by Biba to the range set at
login.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>In all cases, after a change to <tt class="FILENAME">login.conf</tt>, the login class
capability database must be rebuilt using <tt class="COMMAND">cap_mkdb</tt> and this will
be reflected throughout every forthcoming example or discussion.</p>

<p>It is useful to note that many sites may have a particularly large number of users
requiring several different user classes. In depth planning is required as this may get
extremely difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Future versions of FreeBSD will include a new way to deal with mapping users to
labels; however, this will not be available until some time after FreeBSD&nbsp;5.3.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN22204" name="AEN22204">16.4.1.3 Network Interfaces and Label
Settings</a></h3>

<p>Labels may also be set on network interfaces to help control the flow of data across
the network. In all cases they function in the same way the policies function with
respect to objects. Users at high settings in <tt class="LITERAL">biba</tt>, for example,
will not be permitted to access network interfaces with a label of low.</p>

<p>The <code class="OPTION">maclabel</code> may be passed to <tt
class="COMMAND">ifconfig</tt> when setting the <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym>
label on network interfaces. For example:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd
class="USERINPUT">ifconfig bge0 maclabel biba/equal</kbd>
</pre>

<p>will set the <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> label of <tt
class="LITERAL">biba/equal</tt> on the <a
href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bge&amp;sektion=4"><span
class="CITEREFENTRY"><span class="REFENTRYTITLE">bge</span>(4)</span></a> interface. When
using a setting similar to <tt class="LITERAL">biba/high(low-high)</tt> the entire label
should be quoted; otherwise an error will be returned.</p>

<p>Each policy module which supports labeling has a tunable which may be used to disable
the <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> label on network interfaces. Setting the label
to <code class="OPTION">equal</code> will have a similar effect. Review the output from
<tt class="COMMAND">sysctl</tt>, the policy manual pages, or even the information found
later in this chapter for those tunables.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN22226" name="AEN22226">16.4.2 Singlelabel or
Multilabel?</a></h2>

<p>By default the system will use the <code class="OPTION">singlelabel</code> option. But
what does this mean to the administrator? There are several differences which, in their
own right, offer pros and cons to the flexibility in the systems security model.</p>

<p>The <code class="OPTION">singlelabel</code> only permits for one label, for instance
<tt class="LITERAL">biba/high</tt> to be used for each subject or object. It provides for
lower administration overhead but decreases the flexibility of policies which support
labeling. Many administrators may want to use the <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code>
option in their security policy.</p>

<p>The <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code> option will permit each subject or object
to have its own independent <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> label in place of the
standard <code class="OPTION">singlelabel</code> option which will allow only one label
throughout the partition. The <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code> and <code
class="OPTION">single</code> label options are only required for the policies which
implement the labeling feature, including the Biba, Lomac, <acronym
class="ACRONYM">MLS</acronym> and <acronym class="ACRONYM">SEBSD</acronym> policies.</p>

<p>In many cases, the <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code> may not need to be set at
all. Consider the following situation and security model:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>FreeBSD web-server using the <acronym class="ACRONYM">MAC</acronym> framework and a
mix of the various policies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This machine only requires one label, <tt class="LITERAL">biba/high</tt>, for
everything in the system. Here the file system would not require the <code
class="OPTION">multilabel</code> option as a single label will always be in effect.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>But, this machine will be a web server and should have the web server run at <tt
class="LITERAL">biba/low</tt> to prevent write up capabilities. The Biba policy and how
it works will be discussed later, so if the previous comment was difficult to interpret
just continue reading and return. The server could use a separate partition set at <tt
class="LITERAL">biba/low</tt> for most if not all of its runtime state. Much is lacking
from this example, for instance the restrictions on data, configuration and user
settings; however, this is just a quick example to prove the aforementioned point.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the non-labeling policies are to be used, then the <code
class="OPTION">multilabel</code> option would never be required. These include the <tt
class="LITERAL">seeotheruids</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">portacl</tt> and <tt
class="LITERAL">partition</tt> policies.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that using <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code> with a
partition and establishing a security model based on <code
class="OPTION">multilabel</code> functionality could open the doors for higher
administrative overhead as everything in the file system would have a label. This
includes directories, files, and even device nodes.</p>

<p>The following command will set <code class="OPTION">multilabel</code> on the file
systems to have multiple labels. This may only be done in single user mode:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">#</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">tunefs -l enable /</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This is not a requirement for the swap file system.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<blockquote class="NOTE">
<p><b>Note:</b> Some users have experienced problems with setting the <code
class="OPTION">multilabel</code> flag on the root partition. If this is the case, please
review the <a href="mac-troubleshoot.html">Section 16.16</a> of this chapter.</p>

is not completely recommended. Not because it limits the ability to disable features on
the fly with <tt class="COMMAND">sysctl</tt>, but it permits the administrator to
instantly switch the policies of a system without the requirement of rebuilding and
reinstalling a new system.</p>

because of a property of the file, a property of the process, or a property of the
